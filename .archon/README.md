   - Best practices and guidelines

3. **Task Definitions** (`tasks/`)
   - Detailed task breakdowns with dependencies
   - Agent assignments and quality gates
   - Progress tracking and validation criteria

4. **Workflow Automation** (`workflows/`)
   - TDD RED-GREEN-REFACTOR workflow documentation
   - Multi-agent coordination procedures
   - Quality gate enforcement protocols

5. **Execution Scripts** (`scripts/`)
   - Automated workflow execution scripts
   - Quality gate validation tools
   - Agent coordination utilities

6. **Quality Framework** (`quality-gates.md`)
   - Comprehensive quality gate definitions
   - Validation checkpoints and metrics
   - Continuous improvement processes

## Agent Coordination Model

### Primary Agents

#### @tdd-orchestrator
- **Role**: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR coordination
- **Specialization**: Test-driven development methodology
- **Key Activities**: Test creation, implementation guidance, refactoring coordination

#### @code-reviewer
- **Role**: Security and performance validation
- **Specialization**: Code quality, security scanning, performance analysis
- **Key Activities**: Security audits, performance optimization, compliance validation

#### @apex-ui-ux-designer
- **Role**: Accessibility testing and UI validation
- **Specialization**: WCAG 2.1 AA+ compliance, healthcare UX
- **Key Activities**: Accessibility testing, responsive design validation, visual testing

#### @architect-review
- **Role**: Architecture compliance
- **Specialization**: System architecture, design patterns, scalability
- **Key Activities**: Architecture validation, integration review, best practices enforcement

### Coordination Patterns

#### Sequential Workflow
For tasks with dependencies and linear progression:
1. **RED Phase**: @tdd-orchestrator creates failing tests
2. **GREEN Phase**: Implementation with test validation
3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Code improvement with test preservation
4. **Validation**: Multi-agent quality validation

#### Parallel Workflow
For independent tasks that can run concurrently:
- **Security Scanning** (@code-reviewer) + **Accessibility Testing** (@apex-ui-ux-designer)
- **Performance Analysis** (@code-reviewer) + **Architecture Review** (@architect-review)
- **Test Creation** (@tdd-orchestrator) + **Documentation Updates**

## Key Workflows

### TDD RED-GREEN-REFACTOR Workflow

1. **RED Phase**: Write failing tests that define requirements
2. **GREEN Phase**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Improve code quality while maintaining test coverage
4. **Validation**: Multi-agent quality validation

### Multi-Agent Validation Pipeline

1. **TDD Validation**: Test coverage and quality validation
2. **Security Validation**: Vulnerability scanning and compliance checking
3. **Accessibility Validation**: WCAG 2.1 AA+ compliance testing
4. **Architecture Validation**: Design pattern and integration validation

## Quality Gates

### Universal Quality Gates
- **Test Coverage**: â‰¥90% for critical components
- **TypeScript Compliance**: Zero errors in strict mode
- **Build Success**: Successful compilation across all apps
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals compliance

### Agent-Specific Quality Gates
- **@tdd-orchestrator**: TDD methodology compliance, test quality
- **@code-reviewer**: Security zero vulnerabilities, performance benchmarks
- **@apex-ui-ux-designer**: WCAG 2.1 AA+ compliance, responsive design
- **@architect-review**: Architecture patterns, scalability validation

## Usage

### Setting Up the Coordination System

1. **Initialize the Framework**:
   ```bash
   # Review the task management structure
   cat .archon/task-management.json
   
   # Understand agent roles
   cat .archon/knowledge/testing-workflows.md
   ```

2. **Configure Agent Tasks**:
   ```bash
   # Review assigned tasks
   cat .archon/tasks/agent-coordination-tasks.json
   
   # Understand quality gates
   cat .archon/quality-gates.md
   ```

3. **Execute Workflows**:
   ```bash
   # Run TDD orchestrator for a component
   ./.archon/scripts/tdd-orchestrator.sh red-phase ComponentName
   
   # Validate TDD cycle
   ./.archon/scripts/tdd-orchestrator.sh validate-phase ComponentName
   ```

### Agent Coordination Examples

#### Starting a New Feature Development
1. **@tdd-orchestrator**: Create failing tests for new feature
2. **@architect-review**: Validate architecture compliance
3. **Implementation**: Write minimal code to pass tests
4. **@code-reviewer**: Security and performance validation
5. **@apex-ui-ux-designer**: Accessibility and UI validation
6. **@tdd-orchestrator**: Refactoring coordination

#### Coordinated Validation Session
1. **All Agents**: Review feature requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **@tdd-orchestrator**: Validate test coverage and quality
3. **@code-reviewer**: Perform security and performance analysis
4. **@apex-ui-ux-designer**: Conduct accessibility testing
5. **@architect-review**: Validate architecture compliance
6. **All Agents**: Joint sign-off on quality gates
