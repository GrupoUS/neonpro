- Environment variable sanitization

### ✅ 5. Configuration Externalization - COMPLETED

**Fix Applied**: Created centralized configuration system and externalized hardcoded values

**Created**: `/home/vibecode/neonpro/scripts/config.sh`
- Comprehensive configuration file with 50+ variables
- Organized by category: System, Database, Performance, Audit, Healthcare, Server, Monitoring, Security, Build/Deploy, Backup, Notifications
- Built-in validation functions
- Environment-specific configuration support

**Scripts Updated**: All major scripts now load centralized configuration
- `dev-setup.sh`: Uses configuration variables for system requirements
- `emergency-rollback.sh`: Uses configuration for Vercel and health check settings
- `audit-unified.sh`: Uses configuration for audit thresholds and timeouts
- `setup-supabase-migrations.sh`: Uses configuration for database settings

**Benefits**:
- Single source of truth for all configuration values
- Easy environment-specific configuration
- Built-in validation and type checking
- Reduced hardcoded values throughout codebase
- Improved maintainability and consistency

## Technical Implementation Details

### Configuration Management System

```bash
# Centralized configuration loading
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/config.sh"

# Configuration validation
validate_config() {
    # Validates numeric values, percentages, ports, URLs
    # Provides detailed error reporting
}

# Environment-specific overrides
load_environment_config() {
    # Supports development, staging, production environments
    # Merges configurations with proper precedence
}
```

### Security Validation Framework

```bash
# Input validation and sanitization
validate_and_sanitize_input() {
    # Supports: filename, path, command, environment_var, url, percentage, size_mb
    # Prevents: injection attacks, directory traversal, XSS
    # Provides detailed error reporting
}
```

### Database Connection Management

```bash
# Robust database connection handling
test_database_connection() {
    # Timeout handling
    # Retry logic with exponential backoff
    # Connection pooling validation
    # Comprehensive error reporting
}
```

## Quality Metrics

### Code Quality Improvements
