# Development Workflow

> **ü§ñ AI Instructions:** This is the mandatory step-by-step process you MUST follow when developing features, unless the user explicitly requests to skip specific steps. Always follow this workflow systematically.

# MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES ALWAYS READ AND LOAD References

- **üåü Always Read the Complete Workflow**: [`docs/AGENTS.md`](../docs/AGENTS.md)
- **‚öôÔ∏è Always Read the Project Memory**: [`docs/memory.md`](../docs/memory.md)
- **üìö Always Read the @source-tree**: [docs/architecture/source-tree.md](../docs/architecture/source-tree.md)
  - One‚Äëline: Real monorepo structure (apps/packages) validated and categorized
  - Use when: Locating code, packages, or wiring across the repo
- **RIGHT TOOL FOR JOB**: Understand full context before implementation. Choose appropriate technology and mcp tools. Plan carefully, implement systematically.
- **MANDATORY** Use do gerenciador de tasks nativo do augment de forma mais ativa para acompanhar tudo o que precisa ser feito, criando atomic tasks para executar tudo o que foi solicitado em fases
- **MANDATORY** use of `serena mcp` to search codebase and semantic code analysis, _DO NOT USE NATIVE SEARCH CODEBASE tool_
- **MANDATORY** use of `supabase mcp` for database operations
- **MANDATORY** use of `shadcn-ui mcp` to manage ui components
- **MANDATORY** use of `archon mcp` for task and knowledge management
- **MANDATORY** use of `desktop-commander mcp` for file and terminal operations and system management
- **MANDATORY** invoke `sequential-thinking` first and then the `think` native tool before any other action; under ULTRATHINK, always use `think` to produce a 5‚Äëstep breakdown of next steps/strategies to clarify order and purpose.
- **MANDATORY** use of `tavily mcp` for real-time information, current trends, and technology updates, _DO NOT USE NATIVE SEARCH tool_
- **MANDATORY** use of `context7 mcp` for deep contextual understanding and analysis, _DO NOT USE NATIVE CONTEXT tool_
- **NO INTERRUPTIONS**: Continue through ALL steps until problem fully solved.
- **MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Always begin with sequential-thinking tool.
- **ONLY TERMINATE WHEN**: User query COMPLETELY resolved and Problem 100% solved.
- **CRITICAL:This project uses Archon for knowledge management, task tracking, and project organization.**
- Project uses A.P.T.E methodology (Analyze ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Think ‚Üí Execute) with quality standard ‚â•9.5/10, prefers Bun over npm for 3-5x performance improvements, and requires phased migration approach with rollback strategies.
- User prefers comprehensive backend database architecture audits following a 4-phase structured approach: Architecture Analysis ‚Üí Backend Integration Audit ‚Üí Archon Project Creation ‚Üí Task Execution, with mandatory use of serena mcp for codebase analysis, supabase mcp for database operations, and archon mcp for project management, following sequential-thinking ‚Üí research ‚Üí plan ‚Üí implement ‚Üí validate workflow.

## Pre-Development Guidelines

**üìö Documentation Consultation:**
‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Only consult documentation when you have specific questions or uncertainties. Avoid loading unnecessary context.

When you have ANY doubt during development:

- First consult the `/docs` folder for relevant documentation
- Check `docs/architecture/AGENTS.md` for architectural decisions
- Look at `docs/apis/AGENTS.md` for API patterns
- Check `docs/database-schema/AGENTS.md` for data structure
- Consult specific guides in `docs/rules/coding-standards.md` for coding standards, best practices, and design patterns

  1. **RED**: Write failing test first (describe expected behavior)
  2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass the test
  3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code while keeping tests green
  4. **REPEAT**: Continue cycle for next requirement
  - üî• **CRITICAL**: Business logic, AI agents, APIs, financial operations
  - ‚ö° **IMPORTANT**: Complex hooks, utilities, data validation, integrations
  - ‚úÖ **USEFUL**: UI components with logic, helpers

  - Use `serena` for codebase analysis (get_symbols_overview ‚Üí find_symbol)
  - Use `desktop-commander` for file operations (chunked 25-30 lines max)
  - Use `shadcn-ui` to check component availability before custom development
  - Follow established code patterns, naming conventions, and project standards
  - **Stuck >3x**: Use sequential-thinking to reassess
  - Use `think` tool every 5 steps for alignment with requirements
  - Implement comprehensive error handling following project patterns
  - **Test Categories**: Success cases, error cases, edge cases, business logic
  - **Documentation First**: Check existing patterns with `serena`

### 4. **Test Execution & Validation** ‚úÖ

**üîß MCP**: desktop-commander + serena

- Use `desktop-commander` to run all test commands
- Run `bun oxlint apps packages --fix` for linter issues
- Run `bun format && bun lint:fix && bun type-check` to format code

- Fix any errors or warnings before proceeding
- **Correction Loop**: If issues found:
  - Use `serena` to understand code structure and dependencies
  - Fix issues using `desktop-commander` for file operations
  - **Stuck >3x**: Use sequential-thinking to reassess
  - Return to **Step 4** and repeat cycle
  - Continue until ALL quality checks pass
