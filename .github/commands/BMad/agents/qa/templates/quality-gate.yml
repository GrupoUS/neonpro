# Quality Gate Template Notes

# This YAML template provides a comprehensive structure for documenting quality gate decisions
# for NeonPro's brownfield healthcare development. Each section captures critical assessment
# criteria specific to healthcare system integration and AI feature deployment.

# Key principles:
# 1. Patient safety and healthcare workflow integrity are paramount
# 2. Regulatory compliance (LGPD/ANVISA/CFM) must be explicitly validated
# 3. Performance baselines must be maintained for healthcare operations
# 4. Rollback procedures must be tested and ready for emergency deployment
# 5. All decisions must be traceable and auditable for healthcare compliance

# Usage instructions:
# 1. Copy this template for each story requiring a quality gate decision
# 2. Fill in all applicable fields based on comprehensive review results
# 3. Ensure all healthcare-specific validations are explicitly addressed
# 4. Document clear rationale for all gate decisions
# 5. Establish monitoring and rollback procedures before deployment approval
