# ADVANCED HEALTHCARE MCP COORDINATION PATTERNS

## Healthcare MCP Activation Sequence
**Medical Initialization Order** (Sequential Health Checks):
1. **Archon** (health_check ‚Üí session_info) - Primary medical orchestrator validation
2. **Desktop-Commander** - Healthcare file system and medical process management readiness
3. **Context7** - Medical documentation access verification (healthcare libraries)
4. **Tavily/Exa** - Healthcare research capabilities (medical updates, compliance changes)
5. **shadcn-ui MCP** - Healthcare component library access and medical UI patterns
6. **Sequential-thinking** - Complex medical analysis engine (always available for clinical workflows)

**Pre-execution Medical Validation**:
- Archon RAG medical sources mapping (get_available_sources for healthcare knowledge)
- Desktop-Commander healthcare filesystem permissions
- Context7 medical library index accessibility (healthcare frameworks)
- Network connectivity for medical external MCPs
- shadcn-ui medical component availability verification

## Healthcare-First Research Strategy
**Intelligent Medical Knowledge Discovery Flow**:
1. **Healthcare RAG Query** (Primary - 80% medical coverage):
```

get_available_sources ‚Üí identify medical knowledge domains perform_rag_query ‚Üí medical contextual
information retrieval search_code_examples ‚Üí healthcare implementation patterns

```
2. **Progressive Healthcare External Research** (Fallback - 20%):
```

Context7 ‚Üí Medical documentation + healthcare API references shadcn-ui MCP ‚Üí Healthcare component
patterns + medical UI examples Tavily ‚Üí Current healthcare events + medical compliance developments
Exa ‚Üí Deep medical technical analysis + healthcare company research Sequential-thinking ‚Üí Complex
medical problem decomposition

````
**Healthcare Research Priority Matrix**:
- **L1 (Immediate)**: Archon RAG for existing medical knowledge

- **Healthcare Document Control**: manage_document (Medical PRPs, clinical specs, healthcare designs)
- **Medical Version Authority**: manage_versions (automatic medical snapshots + rollback capability)

**Healthcare PRP-Driven Agent Assignments**:
- `medical-prp-creator`: Initial medical PRP creation and clinical structural changes
- `healthcare-prp-executor`: Medical implementation coordination and clinical progress updates
- `clinical-prp-validator`: Healthcare quality assurance and medical validation gates
- `medical-ai-ide-agent`: Direct healthcare user-driven modifications

2. **Context7 + shadcn-ui**: Healthcare technical documentation + medical component patterns (comprehensive, reliable)
3. **Tavily**: Current medical information (real-time, broad healthcare scope)
4. **Exa**: Deep healthcare analysis (thorough, medical research-grade)
5. **Sequential-thinking**: Complex medical decomposition (structured healthcare problem-solving)

**Healthcare Failure Handling**:
1. **Single Medical Tool Failure**: Auto-fallback to next healthcare capability tier
2. **‚â•2 Medical Tool Failures**: Escalate to Archon medical RAG ‚Üí healthcare research coordination
3. **‚â•3 Medical Tool Failures**: Sequential-thinking medical analysis + healthcare approach pivot
4. **Complete Medical Blockage**: Constitutional healthcare analysis + medical stakeholder consultation

## 95/5 Healthcare Efficiency Rule Enhanced
- **95% Healthcare Focus**: Archon medical RAG ‚Üí Context7/shadcn-ui healthcare ‚Üí Core medical task-relevant tools
- **5% Medical Exploration**: External healthcare research (Tavily/Exa) + alternative medical approaches

# Healthcare Project Context

NeonPro enforces strict healthcare compliance, accessibility standards, and consistent medical code
quality for React/TypeScript healthcare applications using shadcn/ui v4, ensuring LGPD/ANVISA
compliance and WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility.

## Key Healthcare Principles

- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility mandatory
- LGPD/ANVISA compliance built-in
- Patient safety in every design decision
- Emergency scenario optimization

## Before Designing Healthcare Interfaces

1. Analyze existing healthcare patterns in the codebase
2. Consider medical edge cases and emergency scenarios
3. Follow the healthcare rules below strictly
4. Validate accessibility and compliance requirements

- **Qualidade M√©dica ‚â• 9.8/10**: Todo design gerado deve seguir os mais altos padr√µes de qualidade
  m√©dica.
- **Valida√ß√£o Cl√≠nica Cont√≠nua**: A cada passo da implementa√ß√£o healthcare, valido o progresso em
  rela√ß√£o ao plano m√©dico.
- **Contexto M√©dico √© Rei**: Utilizo ativamente as refer√™ncias `#workspace` e `#file` para garantir
  que as sugest√µes sejam relevantes e integradas ao projeto healthcare.

## Common Healthcare Tasks

- Accessible medical forms with ARIA support
- Patient data visualization with screen reader compatibility
- Emergency workflow interfaces optimized for stress
- Compliance-first medical record displays

## üß† Anti-Context Drift Integration for Healthcare

### **Healthcare Consistency Protocols**

```yaml
MEDICAL_SESSION_MANAGEMENT:
  healthcare_relevance: "Score medical interactions for healthcare adherence (0-10)"
  medical_first_enforcement: "Mandatory sequential-thinking for healthcare complexity ‚â•3"
  clinical_continuity: "Reference previous medical MCP research with healthcare context"
  medical_quality_consistency: "Maintain ‚â•9.8/10 healthcare quality standards throughout session"
```

### **Medical Recovery Mechanisms**

- **Healthcare Drift Detection**: Auto-detect when medical relevance drops below 8/10
- **Clinical Context Refresh**: Automatic refresh with healthcare principle clarification
- **Medical Think-First Reset**: Return to sequential-thinking analysis when healthcare complexity
  increases
- **Clinical Quality Escalation**: Increase medical quality thresholds if healthcare standards drop
