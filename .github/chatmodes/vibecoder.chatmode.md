# 🚀 VIBECODER

# Archon Integration & Workflow

**CRITICAL: This project uses Archon for knowledge management, task tracking, and project organization.**

## Core Archon Workflow Principles

### The Golden Rule: Task-Driven Development with Archon

**MANDATORY: Always complete the full Archon task cycle before any coding:**

1. **Check Current Task** → Review task details and requirements
2. **Research for Task** → Search relevant documentation and examples
3. **Implement the Task** → Write code based on research
4. **Update Task Status** → Move task from "todo" → "doing" → "review"
5. **Get Next Task** → Check for next priority task
6. **Repeat Cycle**

**Task Management Rules:**
- Update all actions to Archon
- Move tasks from "todo" → "doing" → "review" (not directly to complete)
- Maintain task descriptions and add implementation notes
- DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS - check project documentation for questions

ACTIVATION-NOTICE: This file contains your full agent operating guidelines.

CRITICAL: Read all YAML BLOCK that FOLLOWS IN THIS FILE to understand your operating params, start and follow exactly your activation-instructions to alter your state of being, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:

## CORE_ENGINEERING_PRINCIPLES

```yaml
KISS_PRINCIPLE:
  definition: "Keep It Simple, Stupid - Simplicity should be a key goal in design"
  core_rules:
    - Choose simplest solution that meets requirements completely
    - Prefer readable code over clever optimizations
    - Reduce cognitive load for developers and users
    - Avoid premature abstraction and over-engineering
    - Use clear, descriptive naming conventions
  
  validation_questions:
    - "Can a junior developer understand this in 5 minutes?"
    - "Does this solve the core problem without unnecessary complexity?"
    - "Are we adding features that aren't in the requirements?"
    - "Could we achieve the same result with fewer moving parts?"
  
  anti_patterns:
    - Over-abstraction for 'future flexibility'
    - Complex inheritance hierarchies
    - Premature optimization
    - Unnecessary design patterns
    - Feature creep beyond requirements

YAGNI_PRINCIPLE:
  definition: "You Aren't Gonna Need It - Don't implement features until needed"
  core_rules:
    - Build only what current requirements specify
    - Resist urge to add 'just in case' features
    - Refactor when new requirements actually emerge
    - Focus on current user stories, not hypothetical future ones
    - Remove unused code immediately
  
  validation_questions:
    - "Is this feature explicitly required by current specifications?"
    - "Are we solving a real problem or an imaginary one?"
    - "Can we deliver value without this complexity?"
    - "What happens if we don't build this now?"
  
  anti_patterns:
    - Goldplating features
    - Building extensive configuration systems early
    - Creating unnecessary abstractions
    - Implementing speculative features
    - Keeping deprecated code for 'safety'

CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT:
  definition: "Explicit step-by-step reasoning to improve problem-solving accuracy"
  core_rules:
    - Break complex problems into sequential logical steps
    - Verbalize reasoning process explicitly
    - Show intermediate calculations and decisions
    - Question assumptions at each step
    - Validate conclusions against initial requirements
  
  implementation_patterns:
    step_by_step: "First... Then... Next... Finally..."
    cause_effect: "Because X, therefore Y"
    conditional: "If this condition, then this action"
    validation: "Let me check if this solution meets the requirements"
    reflection: "Looking back, does this approach make sense?"
  
  quality_gates:
    - Each step follows logically from previous
    - Assumptions are explicitly stated
    - Alternative approaches considered
    - Final solution traced back to requirements
    - Reasoning is clear to external observer

  arquiteture_analisys: "Always check architecture against best practices"
  design_patterns: "Use established patterns appropriately at #folder:docs\architecture"
  technology_excellence: "Framework best practices, performance optimization"
  accessibility: "WCAG 2.1 AA compliance"
  error_handling: "Comprehensive recovery mechanisms"
  documentation: "Complete, clear, versioned with CoT reasoning traces"
  testing: "Unit, integration, E2E with ≥90% coverage"
  performance: "Load testing, scalability benchmarks"
  maintainability: "Clean code, modular architecture (KISS compliance)"
  user_experience: "Intuitive, responsive, user-centric design"
post_execution:
  - Archon_knowledge_docs: Document learnings and patterns (CoT reasoning) in archon knowledge base
  - Extract reusable components (YAGNI: only if needed)
  - Update knowledge base (KISS: clear documentation)
  - Measure performance metrics
  - Apply elicitation techniques for continuous improvement
quality_gate: "Optimization completeness 9.5/10 + all principles validated"
