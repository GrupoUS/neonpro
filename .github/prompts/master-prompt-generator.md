## 🚀 A.P.T.E WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: ANALYZE (25%)
```yaml
REQUIREMENTS:
  - Extract explicit and implicit requirements
  - Map stakeholder needs and constraints
  - Define measurable success criteria
  - Identify target platform: [GPT-4|Claude|Copilot|Gemini|Perplexity]
  - Assess complexity: [L1-L5] and domain: [Technical|Creative|Analytical|Research]

QUALITY_GATE: "Analysis completeness ≥9.5/10"
```

### Phase 2: PESQUISAR (30%)
```yaml
RESEARCH:
  - Domain-specific knowledge and best practices
  - Successful prompt patterns for similar tasks
  - Anti-patterns and failure modes
  - Platform-specific optimizations
  - Current trends and constraints

QUALITY_GATE: "Research depth ≥9.5/10"
```

### Phase 3: THINK (20%)
```yaml
COGNITIVE_PROCESSING:
  - Apply 7-layer cognitive architecture (see prompt.md)
  - Design prompt structure: Header → Objective → Context → Methodology → Output
  - Plan validation checkpoints and success metrics
  - Consider edge cases and failure scenarios

QUALITY_GATE: "Logical consistency ≥9.5/10"
```

### Phase 4: ELABORATE (25%)
```yaml
PROMPT_CREATION:
  - Generate structured prompt with clear role and expertise
  - Integrate comprehensive context and constraints
  - Include step-by-step methodology with validation
  - Optimize for token efficiency and platform compatibility

QUALITY_GATE: "Prompt excellence ≥9.5/10"
```

## 💎 OPTIMIZED PROMPT TEMPLATE

```markdown
# [ROLE]: [EXPERTISE] - [DOMAIN] Specialist

## 🎯 MISSION
**Objective**: [SPECIFIC_ACTION] to achieve [MEASURABLE_OUTCOME]
**Quality Standard**: ≥9.5/10 execution quality + ≥95% success rate
**Methodology**: A.P.T.E (Analyze → Pesquisar → Think → Elaborate)

## 🌐 CONTEXT
```yaml
current_state: "[CURRENT_SITUATION]"
constraints:
  technical: "[TECHNICAL_LIMITATIONS]"
  business: "[BUSINESS_REQUIREMENTS]"
  timeline: "[TIME_CONSTRAINTS]"
resources: "[AVAILABLE_TOOLS_AND_CAPABILITIES]"
stakeholders: "[PRIMARY_AND_SECONDARY_USERS]"
```

## 🧠 METHODOLOGY
Apply 7-layer cognitive architecture (referenced in prompt.md):
1. **Analyze**: Break down requirements, identify dependencies
2. **Research**: Gather domain knowledge, validate patterns
3. **Think**: Multi-perspective reasoning, solution design
4. **Elaborate**: Create actionable solution with quality gates

## 📋 OUTPUT FORMAT
```structure
### Analysis: [Requirement breakdown with stakeholder mapping]
### Research: [Domain insights with validated patterns]
### Strategy: [Multi-layer reasoning with solution architecture]
### Implementation: [Actionable solution with validation criteria]
```

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [MEASURABLE_CRITERION_1]
- [MEASURABLE_CRITERION_2]
- [MEASURABLE_CRITERION_3]
```

## 🚫 CRITICAL ANTI-PATTERNS

```yaml
AVOID:
  requirement_ambiguity: "Use SMART criteria + stakeholder validation"
  context_starvation: "Provide complete context checklist"
  reasoning_shallow: "Apply 7-layer cognitive architecture"
  quality_drift: "Maintain ≥9.5/10 quality gates"
  validation_absent: "Include built-in success metrics"
```

## 📊 COMPLEXITY ROUTING

```yaml
L1_simple: "1.0-2.5 → Basic A.P.T.E"
L2_moderate: "2.6-4.0 → Enhanced A.P.T.E" 
L3_complex: "4.1-6.0 → Full A.P.T.E"
L4_enterprise: "6.1-7.5 → Advanced A.P.T.E"
L5_quantum: "7.6-10.0 → Maximum A.P.T.E"
```
