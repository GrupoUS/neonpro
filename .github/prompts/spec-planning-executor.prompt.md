purpose: "Transform any user request into a fully researched PRD, comprehensive implementation plan, and atomic task breakdown aligned with Spec‚ÄëKit SDD and NeonPro standards."
inputs:
  - user_request: "Free‚Äëform request from stakeholder or engineer"
  - context: "Optional context links or constraints"
outputs:
  - prd: "Archon document (type=prd) with full requirements"

## üß≠ Overview
This prompt operationalizes Specification‚ÄëDriven Development (SDD) by combining:
- GitHub Spec‚ÄëKit spec-driven methodology (Specification as primary artifact; plan/code serve the spec)
- NeonPro templates and constitutional gates
- Deep research via Tavily + Context7 + Archon knowledge base
- Task generation with strict quality gates and sequential execution

The assistant MUST produce: (1) a PRD stored in Archon, (2) a full implementation plan, (3) an atomic, parallelizable task list, and (4) research notes with cited sources and confidence.

## üìö Mandatory Pre‚ÄëReads (NeonPro context)
When uncertain, consult only what is needed (minimal context load):
- docs/AGENTS.md (docs orchestrator)
- docs/architecture/AGENTS.md (architecture orchestrator)
- docs/architecture/source-tree.md (@source-tree)
- docs/architecture/tech-stack.md (@tech-stack)
- docs/apis/AGENTS.md (API doc standards)
- docs/database-schema/AGENTS.md (DB schema orchestrator)
- docs/agents/apex-researcher.md (research methodology)
- templates/spec-template.md (feature spec structure)
- templates/plan-template.md (implementation plan structure)

## üîß Required MCP Tools
- Tavily (Real‚Äëtime web research; trends, news, best practices)
- Context7 (Official docs, API references)
- Archon (Knowledge base, PRD/plan/task documents)

## üîê Constitutional & Project Rules (ALWAYS ENFORCE)
- KISS/YAGNI, simplicity gates, anti‚Äëabstraction (avoid wrappers without need)
- Test‚Äëfirst: Contracts ‚Üí Integration/E2E ‚Üí Unit; RED before GREEN
- Every feature as a library with CLI exposure where applicable
- Follow monorepo structure and stack in @source-tree and @tech-stack
- Compliance & security (LGPD/ANVISA/CFM) when healthcare data is involved
- Coding standards in docs/rules/coding-standards.md

## üß† High‚ÄëLevel Execution Flow
1) Understand ‚Üí 2) Research ‚Üí 3) PRD ‚Üí 4) Plan ‚Üí 5) Tasks ‚Üí 6) Quality Gates ‚Üí 7) Final Output

### 1) Understand User Request
- Extract goals, actors, constraints, success metrics
- Identify unknowns ‚Üí mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: question]

### 2) Research (Apex‚ÄëResearcher methodology)
- Classify complexity (L1‚ÄìL10) and choose depth
- Run Archon RAG ‚Üí Context7 ‚Üí Tavily chain
- For each key decision, collect: Decision, Rationale, Alternatives, Sources, Confidence
- Record compliance/security implications when relevant

### 3) PRD Generation (Store in Archon)
Create a PRD aligned with spec-driven and templates/spec-template.md, but business‚Äëfirst:
- Title, Summary, Goals/Non‚ÄëGoals
- Stakeholders & Personas
- User Scenarios (Given/When/Then)
- Functional Requirements (FR‚Äë###; testable; no implementation details)
- Non‚ÄëFunctional Requirements (performance, security, compliance, availability)
- Data Concepts & Relationships (names only; no schema)
- Assumptions, Risks, Out‚Äëof‚ÄëScope
- Open Questions ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Acceptance Criteria and Success Metrics
- Research Appendix (decisions, alternatives, citations, confidence)

Persist via Archon as document_type="prd" with tags, including links to plan and tasks that will be generated next.

### 4) Implementation Plan (templates/plan-template.md)
Follow the local plan template precisely. Include:
- Summary (from PRD)
- Technical Context (language/versions/deps/testing/platform/constraints)
- Constitution Check (simplicity, architecture, testing, observability, versioning)
- Phase 0: Outline & Research consolidation (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
- Phase 1: Design & Contracts (data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md, failing tests first)
- Phase 2: Task Planning Approach (describe only)
- Complexity Tracking (if any gate violated ‚Üí justify)
- Progress Tracking and Gate Status checkboxes

### 5) Atomic Tasks & Subtasks
Output a numbered, dependency‚Äëaware task list with parallelizable [P] marks:
- Order strictly by TDD: generate contracts/tests before implementation
- Dependencies: models ‚Üí services ‚Üí API ‚Üí UI; respect monorepo structure
- Each task includes: purpose, inputs, outputs (files/artifacts), acceptance criteria, related PRD/Plan refs
- Include specific repository paths (e.g., apps/api/src/..., packages/core-services/src/...)
- Enforce security/compliance checks where applicable

### 6) Quality Gates (Do not skip)
- PRD: unambiguous, testable, no implementation details
- Plan: passes Constitution Check; violations justified in Complexity Tracking
- Tasks: each has clear acceptance criteria; tests before code; realistic environments favored
- Cross‚Äëreference: Plan/Tasks link back to PRD FRs and scenarios

## üß± Output Contract (Return Format)
Return a single JSON block under a fenced code block for machine consumption AND human‚Äëreadable sections. Use the structure below (keys required). Then perform Archon writes.

### Human‚ÄëReadable Sections
- Research Summary (bullets with sources + confidence)
- PRD (clear sections, no implementation details)
- Plan (as per template with gates)
- Tasks (numbered, grouped by phase with [P] markers)


## üß© Feature Documentation File (docs/features/[feature-name].md)
Create a comprehensive feature documentation file to align product, research, and engineering:

- Filename: `[feature-name].md` (kebab-case)
- Sections:
  - Feature overview and business context
  - Technical architecture decisions from research
  - Implementation approach and key components
  - API endpoints and data models involved (paths reference `docs/architecture/source-tree.md` conventions)
  - Testing strategy and acceptance criteria (test-first: contracts ‚Üí integration ‚Üí unit)
  - Compliance considerations (LGPD/ANVISA/CFM, if applicable)
  - Dependencies and integration points
  - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
  - Links to PRD and Implementation Plan in Archon (use returned IDs: `links.archon_prd_id`, `links.archon_plan_id`)

Write this file to `docs/features/[feature-name].md` and ensure it references the exact repo paths and Archon document links.

## üóÇÔ∏è Archon Writeback (required)
After producing the JSON and human sections:
1) Create PRD document in Archon:
   - create_document(project_id=?, title, document_type="prd", tags=["spec-kit","prd"], content=PRD JSON + human)
   - Save returned document_id and echo it in `links.archon_prd_id`
2) Create Plan document:
   - create_document(project_id=?, title, document_type="design", tags=["plan","templates/plan-template.md"], content=Plan JSON + human)
   - Save document_id ‚Üí `links.archon_plan_id`
3) Create Tasks (optional if Archon tasks are enabled):
   - For each task, create_task(project_id=?, title, description, feature=?, sources=[docs refs])

Note: If project_id is unknown, ask user for the target Archon project once (then cache/reference it in output).

## üß™ Research Protocol (Apex‚ÄëResearcher)
- Use archon.perform_rag_query first for internal knowledge
- Use context7 for official docs (frameworks, APIs). Resolve library IDs via resolve-library-id before fetching docs
- Use tavily for real‚Äëtime best practices and validation
- For each critical decision, ensure multi‚Äësource validation and list trade‚Äëoffs
- Record confidence scores and compliance implications (LGPD/ANVISA/CFM) where relevant

## üß± Planning Constraints
- Enforce templates/plan-template.md phases and gates strictly
- Keep the plan high‚Äëlevel and move deep details to implementation‚Äëdetails files as needed
- Ensure repository paths conform to docs/architecture/source-tree.md
- Respect current stack versions from docs/architecture/tech-stack.md

## ‚úÖ Completion Criteria
- PRD: Complete, unambiguous, linked to research and acceptance metrics
- Plan: Passes Constitution Check (or justified), includes Phase 0/1 outputs
- Tasks: 25‚Äì40 granular items, parallelization tagged, each with acceptance criteria
- Research: Cited sources with credibility and confidence
- Archon: PRD and Plan persisted; IDs returned in `links`

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execution Instructions
Given ${user_request} (and optional ${context}):
1) Run the Research Protocol
2) Draft PRD with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers, resolve via research; keep unresolved markers visible
3) Generate the Plan per template with gates and Phase 0/1 outputs
4) Generate Atomic Tasks, ordered for TDD and dependency chains, with [P] for independent tasks
5) Return outputs in the Machine‚ÄëReadable Block + Human‚ÄëReadable Sections
6) Persist PRD & Plan to Archon (request project_id if missing)
7) Create the Feature Documentation file at `docs/features/[feature-name].md` with the specified sections and Archon links
8) Print a concise summary of next actions
