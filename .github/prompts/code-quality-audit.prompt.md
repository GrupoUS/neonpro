```

### Example 3: Database Schema Changes

```yaml
feature: "patient-data-model-enhancement"
complexity: "high (9/10)"

```

## üß© Minimal Code Examples

### Type Safety Improvements

```typescript
// Before - unsafe any types
type Handler = (c: any) => any;
const patientData: any = getPatientData(id);

// After - strict TypeScript with proper typing
type Handler = (c: Context) => Response | Promise<Response>;
interface Patient {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  // Properly typed patient interface
}
const patientData: Patient = await getPatientData(id);
```

### ES Module Imports

```typescript
// Before - CommonJS
const { execSync } = require("node:child_process");
const express = require("express");

// After - ES modules
import { execSync } from "node:child_process";
import express from "express";
```

### Security Pattern Examples

```typescript
// Before - potential SQL injection
const query = `SELECT * FROM patients WHERE name = '${name}'`;

// After - parameterized queries with RLS
const patients = await prisma.patient.findMany({
  where: {
    name: { contains: name },
    clinicId: context.clinicId, // RLS enforced
  },
});
```

      - "Security-auditor takes immediate control"
      - "Document violation scope and impact"
      - "Notify compliance officer and project owner"

    remediation_process:
      - "Full security audit by security-auditor"
      - "System architecture review by architect-review"
      - "Code quality assessment by code-reviewer"
      - "Compliance testing by test agent"

    prevention_protocol:
      - "Enhanced pre-commit compliance checks"
      - "Improved agent training on compliance"
      - "Enhanced security patterns and validation"

```

### Agent Conflict Resolution

```yaml
conflict_resolution:
