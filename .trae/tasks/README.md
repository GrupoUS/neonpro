# 🚀 NeonPro Trae Tasks Configuration

## 📋 Overview

This directory contains task configurations for the NeonPro AI Healthcare Platform, migrated from global Trae IDE settings to project-specific configurations.

## 📁 File Structure

```
.trae/tasks/
├── tasks.json           # Original tasks migrated from global config
├── neonpro-tasks.json   # Enhanced healthcare-specific tasks
└── README.md           # This documentation
```

## 🔄 Migration Process

### What Was Done

1. **Created Tasks Directory**: Organized task configurations in `.trae/tasks/`
2. **Migrated Global Config**: Copied `tasks.json` from `C:\Users\Mauri\AppData\Roaming\Trae\User\`
3. **Enhanced Configuration**: Created `neonpro-tasks.json` with healthcare-specific tasks
4. **Integrated with Archon**: Connected task system with Archon MCP server
5. **Project Configuration**: Created `trae.config.json` for project-wide settings

### Benefits

- ✅ **Project-Specific**: Tasks are now specific to NeonPro project
- ✅ **Healthcare Compliance**: Added LGPD, ANVISA, and CFM compliance tasks
- ✅ **AI-First Development**: Integrated AI model testing and validation
- ✅ **Performance Monitoring**: Emergency response and healthcare operation benchmarks
- ✅ **Archon Integration**: Seamless task management with MCP server

## 🏥 Healthcare-Specific Tasks

### Compliance Tasks
- `🏥 Healthcare Compliance Check` - LGPD, ANVISA, CFM validation
- `🔒 Security Audit` - Healthcare data security assessment
- `📊 Code Quality Gate` - ≥9.8/10 quality standard

### Performance Tasks
- `🚨 Emergency Response Test` - <200ms critical patient data access
- `⚡ Performance Benchmark` - Healthcare ops <2s, AI <500ms
- `🤖 AI Model Tests` - AI validation and performance

### Development Tasks
- `🚀 NeonPro Dev Server` - AI streaming development server
- `🧬 Database Migration` - Supabase migrations with audit trail
- `🎭 E2E Healthcare Flows` - Critical healthcare workflow testing

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### tasks.json (Original)
Migrated from global Trae IDE configuration, contains:
- Code formatting and linting
- Test execution
- Build processes

### neonpro-tasks.json (Enhanced)
Healthcare-specific enhancements:
- Compliance validation
- Performance benchmarking
- AI model testing
- Security auditing
- Archon integration

### trae.config.json (Project Config)
Main project configuration:
- Task file references
- Archon MCP integration
- Healthcare compliance settings
- AI framework configuration
- Quality gates and performance targets

## 🤖 Archon Integration

The task system is integrated with Archon MCP server for:
- **Task Management**: Centralized task tracking and execution
- **Knowledge Management**: Project documentation and standards
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Automated task dependencies
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time task status updates

### Archon Commands
- `📋 Archon Task Sync` - Synchronize tasks with MCP server
- Automatic task status updates
- Integration with project workflows

## 🎯 Usage

### Running Tasks
1. Use Trae IDE task runner (Ctrl+Shift+P → "Tasks: Run Task")
2. Select from available task categories:
   - **Build**: Development and quality tasks
   - **Test**: Testing and validation tasks
   - **Healthcare**: Compliance and security tasks

### Task Categories
- **Build Tasks**: Development, formatting, linting, quality gates
- **Test Tasks**: Unit tests, E2E tests, AI model validation
- **Healthcare Tasks**: Compliance checks, security audits, performance benchmarks

## 📈 Performance Targets

| Category | Target | Task |
|----------|--------|------|
| Emergency Response | <200ms | Critical patient data access |
| Healthcare Operations | <2s | General healthcare workflows |
| AI Response | <500ms | AI model interactions |
| Code Quality | ≥9.8/10 | Quality gate validation |
| Test Coverage | ≥95% | Healthcare feature coverage |

## 🔒 Compliance Standards

- **LGPD**: Brazilian data protection compliance
- **ANVISA Class IIa**: Medical device software compliance
- **CFM Ethics**: Medical ethics and professional conduct

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Customize Tasks**: Modify tasks based on specific project needs
2. **Add Scripts**: Create corresponding package.json scripts
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Connect tasks with GitHub Actions workflows
4. **Team Onboarding**: Share configuration with development team
