- Well-structured consent management framework
- Detailed database models with compliance features
- Role-based access control implementation

### 10.3 Critical Weaknesses
- Security package not implemented (placeholder only)
- No data encryption at rest or in transit
- No breach detection or notification systems
- No automated data deletion mechanisms
- Data Protection Officer not appointed

### 10.4 Compliance Timeline

| Phase | Activities | Timeline | Target Compliance |
|-------|------------|----------|------------------|
| Phase 1 | Critical Security | 0-30 days | 75% |
| Phase 2 | Data Management | 30-60 days | 85% |
| Phase 3 | Compliance Governance | 60-90 days | 95% |

### 10.5 Final Recommendations
