## Architecture Documents Loaded

### Core Documentation
- **docs/AGENTS.md**: Documentation orchestrator with navigation matrix and pre-development guidelines
- **docs/architecture/AGENTS.md**: Architecture orchestrator with system architecture context
- **docs/architecture/source-tree.md**: Detailed monorepo structure with 2 apps and 7 packages
- **docs/architecture/tech-stack.md**: Technology stack with pinned versions and rationale
- **docs/rules/coding-standards.md**: Healthcare-specific coding standards with LGPD compliance

### Key Findings from Documentation
1. **Monorepo Structure**: Turborepo-based with 2 applications (api, web) and 7 shared packages
2. **Technology Stack**: Modern stack with React 19, TypeScript 5.7.2, Hono.dev, Supabase
3. **Healthcare Focus**: LGPD/ANVISA/CFM compliance built into architecture and coding standards
4. **Quality Standards**: ≥9.5/10 quality target with comprehensive testing requirements
5. **Security**: Row-level security, data encryption, audit trails, and PII protection

## Next Steps
Proceeding to Phase 2: Repository Analysis using Serena MCP for codebase analysis and validation.
