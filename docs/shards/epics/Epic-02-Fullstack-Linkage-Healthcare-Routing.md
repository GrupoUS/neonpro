### **Task 2.3: Supabase RLS Multi-Tenant Implementation** üîê

**Priority**: CRITICAL - Patient Data Protection
**Agent**: apex-dev + security validation + ultrathink

- [ ] **Patient Data Isolation**: RLS policies for multi-clinic patient separation
- [ ] **Medical Professional Access**: Role-based data access with CFM validation
- [ ] **MFA Enforcement**: Database-level `aal2` requirement for sensitive operations
- [ ] **Audit Trail Foundation**: Patient data access logging without PHI exposure

**RLS Implementation**:

```sql
-- Patient data isolation policy
CREATE POLICY "Patient data isolation" ON patient_records
  FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (
    clinic_id = (auth.jwt() -> 'app_metadata' ->> 'clinic_id')
    AND (
      patient_id = auth.uid() -- Patients see own records
      OR
      auth.jwt() -> 'app_metadata' ->> 'role' IN ('doctor', 'nurse', 'admin')
    )
  );

-- MFA requirement for treatment modifications
CREATE POLICY "MFA required for treatment modifications" ON treatments
  FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
  USING (
    (auth.jwt() ->> 'aal') = 'aal2'
    AND auth.jwt() -> 'app_metadata' ->> 'role' IN ('doctor', 'nurse')
  );
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- ‚úÖ Patient data completely isolated by clinic
- ‚úÖ Medical professional role access validated
- ‚úÖ MFA enforced for sensitive medical operations
- ‚úÖ Audit trail logging functional without PHI exposure

### **Task 2.4: Healthcare Authentication Flow** üîê

**Priority**: HIGH - Medical Professional Validation
**Agent**: apex-dev + regulatory compliance

- [ ] **CFM Professional Integration**: Medical license validation and verification
- [ ] **Healthcare Role Management**: Doctor/nurse/admin/patient role assignment
- [ ] **Medical Emergency Access**: Override protocols for critical patient situations
- [ ] **Session Management**: Healthcare-appropriate session duration and security

**Healthcare Roles**:

- `doctor`: Full patient access + treatment modification
- `nurse`: Patient care access + limited modification
- `admin`: Administrative access + billing
- `patient`: Own data access only
- `emergency`: Critical access override (audit logged)

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- ‚úÖ CFM professional license validation operational
- ‚úÖ Healthcare role-based access control functional
- ‚úÖ Medical emergency access protocols validated
- ‚úÖ Secure healthcare session management implemented

### **Task 2.5: API Route Healthcare Validation** üîó

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Backend Integrity
**Agent**: apex-dev + api validation

- [ ] **Healthcare API Audit**: Map all backend routes to frontend usage
- [ ] **Medical Workflow APIs**: Ensure all patient care APIs are functional
- [ ] **Orphaned Route Resolution**: Handle unused backend services appropriately
- [ ] **Healthcare Performance**: Optimize medical data API response times

**API Validation Strategy**:

- Map every frontend API call to existing backend route
- Identify orphaned routes: deprecate, document, or create frontend interface
