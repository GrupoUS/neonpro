## US-004: ML-Powered No-Show Risk Scoring

**User Type:** Practice Manager

**Story:** As a practice manager, I want to see real-time no-show risk scores for upcoming appointments in my existing dashboard, so that I can proactively address high-risk appointments and optimize practice revenue.

**Business Value:** Enables proactive intervention resulting in 25% reduction in no-shows, protecting $468,750+ annual revenue

### Acceptance Criteria:

- GIVEN appointments are scheduled in the existing system, WHEN viewing the appointment calendar, THEN risk scores (0-100) are displayed as color-coded indicators without disrupting current layout
- GIVEN the ML model analyzes patient data, WHEN calculating risk scores, THEN it uses existing patient history, weather data, and behavioral patterns while respecting privacy settings
- GIVEN risk scores are above 70%, WHEN displayed in dashboard, THEN clear visual indicators (red/orange) alert staff without breaking existing dashboard functionality
- GIVEN staff clicks on risk indicator, WHEN viewing details, THEN explanation of risk factors displays in modal using existing UI components
- GIVEN risk scores are calculated, WHEN stored, THEN data integrates with existing appointment records without schema modifications

### Integration Points:

**Existing Systems:**

- Current appointment calendar and scheduling interface
- Existing patient database and history records
- Current dashboard layout and navigation patterns
- Existing notification and alert systems

**New Components:**

- ML risk scoring engine with TensorFlow.js models
- Risk visualization components using existing design system
- Background data processing for pattern recognition
- Risk factor explanation system with healthcare context

### Brownfield Constraints:

- **UI Preservation:** Risk indicators must integrate seamlessly with existing appointment calendar without layout disruption
- **Performance Requirements:** Risk calculation must not slow down existing appointment loading or navigation
- **Data Compatibility:** Risk scores must be stored as additional metadata without modifying existing appointment schema
- **Privacy Compliance:** ML processing must respect existing patient privacy settings and LGPD requirements

### Technical Implementation:

- **ML Engine:** Client-side TensorFlow.js models processing existing appointment and patient behavior data
- **Risk Visualization:** Color-coded badges and progress indicators using shadcn/ui components
- **Data Pipeline:** Background processing pipeline analyzing patterns from existing database tables
- **Caching Strategy:** Risk scores cached using existing Redis infrastructure with intelligent invalidation

## US-005: Automated Intervention Strategy Selection

**User Type:** Healthcare Staff

**Story:** As a healthcare staff member, I want the system to automatically select and execute the most effective intervention strategy for high-risk patients, so that I can prevent no-shows without manual decision-making or additional workload.

**Business Value:** Maximizes intervention effectiveness with 78%+ success rate while reducing staff administrative burden by 30%

### Acceptance Criteria:

- GIVEN a patient has high no-show risk (>70%), WHEN 24-48 hours before appointment, THEN system automatically selects optimal intervention (SMS, call, reschedule offer) based on patient profile
- GIVEN intervention strategy is selected, WHEN executed, THEN it uses existing communication infrastructure (SMS service, phone system) without requiring new provider setup
- GIVEN patient responds to intervention, WHEN confirming or rescheduling, THEN system updates existing appointment records through current API endpoints
- GIVEN multiple patients need intervention, WHEN processing queue, THEN system prioritizes based on appointment value and success probability without overwhelming communication channels
- GIVEN intervention is completed, WHEN tracking success, THEN results are recorded for ML model improvement and integrate with existing analytics

### Integration Points:

**Existing Systems:**

- Current SMS and communication infrastructure
- Existing appointment modification and rescheduling workflows
- Current patient preference settings and contact information
- Existing staff notification and task management systems

**New Components:**

- Intervention strategy selection algorithm based on patient behavior patterns
- Automated communication scheduling and execution system
- Success tracking and ML feedback loop for strategy optimization
- Patient response handling and appointment update automation### Brownfield Constraints:
- **Communication Integration:** Must use existing SMS/phone infrastructure without requiring new service provider setup
- **Appointment Workflow Preservation:** All appointment modifications must follow existing scheduling rules and staff approval processes
- **Patient Preference Respect:** Interventions must respect existing patient communication preferences and opt-out settings
- **Staff Notification Integration:** Failed interventions must integrate with existing staff task and notification systems

### Technical Implementation:

- **Strategy Engine:** Decision tree algorithm analyzing patient history, preferences, and success rates from existing data
- **Automation Pipeline:** Background job scheduler integrating with existing Supabase functions and Edge Functions
- **Communication Adapter:** Wrapper around existing communication APIs (Resend for SMS) with unified interface
- **Feedback Loop:** Success/failure data collection feeding back into ML model for continuous improvement

## US-006: No-Show Pattern Analytics Dashboard

**User Type:** Practice Owner

**Story:** As a practice owner, I want to view comprehensive analytics about no-show patterns, intervention effectiveness, and revenue impact in my existing analytics dashboard, so that I can make data-driven decisions to optimize practice operations.

**Business Value:** Provides actionable insights enabling continuous optimization of no-show prevention, maximizing the $468,750+ annual revenue protection

### Acceptance Criteria:

- GIVEN no-show data is collected, WHEN viewing analytics dashboard, THEN new sections show pattern analysis (time-based, weather-based, demographic) integrated with existing dashboard layout
- GIVEN intervention campaigns are executed, WHEN viewing results, THEN effectiveness metrics (success rate, ROI, patient satisfaction) display using existing chart and graph components
- GIVEN revenue impact is calculated, WHEN displaying financial benefits, THEN integration with existing financial reporting and KPI displays without breaking current functionality
- GIVEN patterns are identified, WHEN viewing recommendations, THEN actionable insights display with clear next steps for practice optimization
- GIVEN data exports are requested, WHEN generating reports, THEN no-show analytics integrate with existing reporting infrastructure and formats### Integration Points:

**Existing Systems:**

- Current analytics dashboard and reporting infrastructure
- Existing financial reporting and KPI tracking systems
- Current data export and report generation capabilities
- Existing chart and visualization components

**New Components:**

- No-show pattern analysis engine with statistical modeling
- Intervention campaign tracking and ROI calculation system
- Predictive analytics for future no-show trends and seasonal patterns
- Recommendation engine for practice optimization based on patterns

### Brownfield Constraints:

- **Dashboard Integration:** New analytics sections must integrate seamlessly with existing dashboard layout and navigation
- **Data Consistency:** Analytics must use existing data models and calculation methods where applicable
- **Export Compatibility:** Reports must be compatible with existing export formats and distribution methods
- **Performance Preservation:** Analytics processing must not impact existing dashboard load times or responsiveness

### Technical Implementation:

- **Analytics Engine:** Statistical analysis of no-show patterns using existing appointment and patient data
- **Visualization Components:** New chart types using existing dashboard component library (Chart.js/Recharts)
- **Data Aggregation:** Background processing for analytics calculation with caching using existing infrastructure
- **Report Generation:** Extension of existing reporting system with new no-show specific metrics and insights
