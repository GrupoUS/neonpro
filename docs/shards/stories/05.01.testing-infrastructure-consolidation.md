# Story 05.01: Testing Infrastructure Consolidation & Biome-Exclusive Linting

## Status
**ACTUAL STATUS: FULLY IMPLEMENTED** ✅

**Reality Check**: Testing infrastructure is ALREADY completely implemented and functional as evidenced by package.json scripts and working test suites. This story was completed in real implementation, not just documentation.

## Story
**As a** development team,
**I want** all testing infrastructure consolidated into a unified Turborepo-compliant structure with Biome as the exclusive linter/formatter,
**so that** we have consistent test organization, reduced duplication, improved maintainability, and unified code quality tooling across the monorepo.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All unit tests from `__tests__/` are consolidated into `tools/testing/unit/`
2. All E2E tests from `playwright/` are consolidated into `tools/testing/e2e/`
3. All test mocks from `__mocks__/` are consolidated into `tools/testing/mocks/`
4. All test reports from `test-results/` and `playwright-report/` are consolidated into `tools/testing/reports/`
5. Test configurations are updated to reflect new structure
6. Turborepo tasks are updated for the new testing structure
7. **Biome+Ultracite is the exclusive linter/formatter** (Prettier completely removed)
8. All legacy test folders are removed after successful migration
9. Documentation is updated to reflect new testing organization and linting policy

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story builds on the Turborepo audit findings and addresses testing infrastructure fragmentation identified in the monorepo analysis.

### Current Testing Structure Issues
- **Fragmented Structure**: Tests scattered across `__tests__/`, `playwright/`, `test-results/`, `playwright-report/`
- **Empty Directories**: `__mocks__/` is empty but should be organized for future use
- **Configuration Drift**: Test configurations reference multiple scattered locations
- **Linting/Formatting Inconsistency**: Prettier and Biome overlap creating configuration conflicts
- **Turborepo Integration**: Current structure doesn't leverage Turborepo testing best practices

### Biome-Exclusive Linting/Formatting Policy
- **Single Source of Truth**: Biome+Ultracite as the only linter and formatter
- **Configuration Simplicity**: Remove Prettier to eliminate tooling conflicts
- **Performance**: Faster linting/formatting with unified Rust-based tooling
- **Consistency**: Same formatting rules across all packages and workspaces
- **Future-Proof**: Modern tooling aligned with Turborepo best practices

### File Locations
- Base directory: `tools/testing/`
- Follow Turborepo workspace structure conventions
- Maintain clear separation between unit and E2E tests
- Centralize all test-related configurations

### Testing Requirements
- Maintain existing test functionality during migration
- Ensure all test scripts continue to work
- Preserve test history and reports where possible
- Update CI/CD to use new structure
- **Ensure Biome handles all linting and formatting consistently**
- **Remove all Prettier dependencies and configurations**
- **Validate VSCode integration with Biome formatter**

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain Playwright configuration compatibility
- Must ensure Turbo cache continues to work for tests
- Must maintain import paths after migration
- **Must ensure Biome+Ultracite configuration is compatible across all workspaces**
- **Must remove Prettier without breaking existing workflows**


## Testing
### Testing Standards
- Verify all migrated tests continue to pass
- Test configuration updates work correctly
- Validate Turborepo task execution with new structure
