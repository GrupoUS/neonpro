- Compliance configs: `tools/compliance/`

### Technical Constraints
- Must support monorepo structure
- Must integrate with Turborepo caching
- Must comply with healthcare regulations
- Must maintain fast CI/CD pipeline performance

### Healthcare-Specific Requirements
- LGPD compliance automation
- ANVISA regulation validation
- CFM professional standards checking
- Patient data privacy protection
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Audit trail generation

## Testing
### Testing Standards
- All workflows must pass on sample PRs
