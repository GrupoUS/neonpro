# Story 2.3: Utilities Package Consolidation - Brownfield Addition

## Status

Completed

## Story

**As a** Developer,
**I want** all root-level utility libraries consolidated into the packages/utils package,
**So that** shared utilities are properly organized and reusable across the monorepo following Turborepo patterns.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Current root `lib/` directory with auth, compliance, database, security utilities
- Technology: TypeScript, utility functions, shared business logic
- Follows pattern: Existing `packages/utils/` structure that needs content migration
- Touch points: Applications importing from root lib/, shared utility functions

**Current State:**
- Root `lib/` contains: `auth/`, `compliance/`, `database/`, `security/` directories
- `packages/utils/` exists but needs content from root lib/
- Mixed import patterns between root lib/ and packages/utils/

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Move all root `lib/` directories to `packages/utils/src/`
2. Consolidate auth, compliance, database, and security utilities
3. Update package exports to include all utility functions

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing utility imports continue to work via workspace references
5. New utilities follow existing `packages/utils/` pattern
6. Integration maintains current functionality across all utilities

**Quality Requirements:**

7. All utility functions are preserved and functional
8. Package builds independently with proper TypeScript support
9. No regression in existing utility functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Move root `lib/` content to `packages/utils/src/`
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow established `packages/utils/` structure
- **Key Constraints**: Maintain all existing utility functionality and API compatibility

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Phase 1: Utility Migration Analysis

- [ ] **Task 1.1: Analyze Root Lib Structure**
  - [ ] Inventory all files in `lib/auth/`
  - [ ] Inventory all files in `lib/compliance/`
  - [ ] Inventory all files in `lib/database/`
  - [ ] Inventory all files in `lib/security/`
  - [ ] Identify any circular dependencies or conflicts

### Phase 2: Content Migration

- [ ] **Task 2.1: Move Auth Utilities**
  - [ ] Move `lib/auth/` to `packages/utils/src/auth/`
  - [ ] Verify all auth utility functions are intact
  - [ ] Check for any auth-specific dependencies
  - [ ] Test authentication utility functions

- [ ] **Task 2.2: Move Compliance Utilities**
  - [ ] Move `lib/compliance/` to `packages/utils/src/compliance/`
  - [ ] Verify LGPD/ANVISA compliance functions
  - [ ] Check Brazilian regulation utility functions
  - [ ] Test compliance validation functions

- [ ] **Task 2.3: Move Database Utilities**
  - [ ] Move `lib/database/` to `packages/utils/src/database/`
  - [ ] Verify database helper functions
  - [ ] Check connection and query utilities
  - [ ] Test database utility operations

- [ ] **Task 2.4: Move Security Utilities**
  - [ ] Move `lib/security/` to `packages/utils/src/security/`
  - [ ] Verify encryption and security functions
  - [ ] Check authentication security helpers
  - [ ] Test security utility operations

### Phase 3: Package Configuration Update

- [ ] **Task 3.1: Update Package Exports**
  - [ ] Update `packages/utils/src/index.ts` to export new utilities
  - [ ] Add proper TypeScript declarations
  - [ ] Create barrel exports for each utility category
  - [ ] Organize exports by functionality

- [ ] **Task 3.2: Update Package Dependencies**
  - [ ] Add any new dependencies required by migrated utilities
  - [ ] Update `packages/utils/package.json` dependencies
  - [ ] Ensure peer dependencies are properly configured
  - [ ] Add any required dev dependencies

### Phase 4: Import Path Validation

- [ ] **Task 4.1: Test Workspace Integration**
  - [ ] Verify package builds with new utilities
  - [ ] Test imports from other packages
  - [ ] Validate TypeScript type checking
  - [ ] Check for any build conflicts

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All root `lib/` content moved to `packages/utils/src/`
- [ ] Auth, compliance, database, and security utilities preserved
- [ ] Package exports include all utility functions
- [ ] Package builds independently without errors
- [ ] TypeScript declarations are complete and accurate
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing utility APIs
- [ ] All utility functions tested and functional
- [ ] Import paths updated where necessary

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Primary Risk:** Breaking existing imports from root lib/ directory
**Mitigation:** Update import paths systematically, maintain API compatibility
**Rollback:** Restore lib/ directory to root location using git

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to utility function APIs
- [ ] All authentication utilities remain functional
- [ ] LGPD/ANVISA compliance functions work correctly
- [ ] Database utilities maintain current behavior
- [ ] Security functions preserve encryption/decryption

## Utility Categories Analysis

**Auth Utilities:**
- Authentication helpers
- Token management
- Session handling
- User permission checks

**Compliance Utilities:**
- LGPD data protection functions
- ANVISA regulatory compliance
- Brazilian healthcare regulations
- Audit trail utilities

**Database Utilities:**
- Query helpers
- Connection management
- Data transformation
- Migration utilities

**Security Utilities:**
- Encryption/decryption functions
- Password hashing
- Data sanitization
- Security validation

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisite**: Understanding of current utility usage patterns
- **Blocks**: Required before import path updates in Story 2.6
- **Technology**: TypeScript, utility libraries, shared business logic
