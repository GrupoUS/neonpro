# Story 1.3: Align PRD with Implementation Reality

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** Product Owner and Development Team,
**I want** a PRD document that accurately reflects the current implementation state and technical capabilities,
**so that** we can make realistic product decisions and align business objectives with technical reality.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Update tech stack descriptions to match actual package.json dependencies
2. Align business objectives with current project maturity and capabilities
3. Include real implementation constraints and technical debt considerations
4. Update compliance requirements to reflect implemented vs planned features
5. Add metrics and KPIs that align with actual system capabilities
6. Connect strategic goals with technical implementation reality
7. Include monorepo structure benefits and constraints
8. Update aesthetic clinic workflows to match actual implementation

## Dev Notes

### Current PRD Issues Identified

- PRD focuses heavily on "enhancement" architecture but codebase shows mature implementation
- Business objectives appear theoretical and not grounded in current capabilities
- Tech stack descriptions don't match actual package.json dependencies
- Missing integration between strategic goals and technical implementation reality

### Actual Implementation State

Based on package.json analysis and codebase review:

- **Mature Monorepo**: PNPM workspaces with Turborepo optimization
- **Next.js 15.1.0**: Modern App Router implementation
- **Prisma ORM**: Database modeling and migrations
- **Biome**: Modern linting and formatting
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Jest, Testing Library, Playwright
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript 5.7.2 with strict configuration

### Technology Stack Reality

```json
{
  "next": "15.1.0",
  "typescript": "5.7.2",
  "prisma": "^5.x.x",
  "@biomejs/biome": "^1.x.x",
  "supabase": "^2.x.x"
}
```

### Business Objective Realignment Areas

- **Current Maturity**: Move from "enhancement" mindset to "optimization" mindset
- **Real Capabilities**: Focus on actual implemented features vs theoretical enhancements
- **User Base**: Document actual user feedback and usage patterns
- **Market Position**: Real competitive advantages vs aspirational goals

### Implementation Constraints to Document

- **Technical Debt**: Areas requiring refactoring
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Real system limitations
- **Resource Constraints**: Development team capacity
- **Regulatory Timeline**: Actual compliance implementation schedule

### Metrics Alignment with Reality

- **Performance**: Real Core Web Vitals measurements
- **User Experience**: Actual user journey completion rates
- **Development Velocity**: Real sprint completion rates
- **System Reliability**: Actual uptime and error rates

### Healthcare Domain Reality

- **LGPD Compliance**: Current implementation status vs full compliance
- **Multi-tenancy**: Actual clinic onboarding capabilities
- **Data Security**: Implemented encryption and access controls
- **User Roles**: Current role-based access implementation

### File Structure Context

```
E:\neonpro\docs\prd.md (main document to update)
E:\neonpro\package.json (tech stack reference)
E:\neonpro\apps\web\package.json (application dependencies)
E:\neonpro\prisma\schema.prisma (data model reality)
```

### Validation Sources

- Package.json dependencies for tech stack reality
- Actual user personas from front-end-spec.md
- Architecture implementation from codebase analysis
- Performance metrics from actual application monitoring
