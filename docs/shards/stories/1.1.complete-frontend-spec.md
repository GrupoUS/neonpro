## Story

**As a** Frontend Developer,
**I want** a complete and modern frontend specification document,
**so that** I can understand the full UI/UX requirements, component patterns, and implementation guidelines for the NeonPro aesthetic clinic system.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Complete all truncated sections in front-end-spec.md after the site map
2. Update all UI patterns to reflect Next.js 15 App Router and modern React patterns
3. Include comprehensive shadcn/ui component integration guidelines
4. Add accessibility compliance guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA)
5. Include real-time UI patterns for clinic management workflows
6. Add progressive enhancement and loading state strategies
7. Include TypeScript component patterns and types
8. Align with actual NeonPro aesthetic clinic personas and workflows

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Alignment

This story requires completion of the front-end-spec.md file which was identified as critically incomplete during the documentation analysis. The file currently cuts off after the site map section and needs comprehensive completion to support development work.

### Technology Stack Context

- **Next.js 15.1.0**: App Router patterns, Server Components, Suspense
- **React 18/19**: Modern hooks, concurrent features
- **TypeScript 5.7.2**: Strict typing, interface definitions
- **shadcn/ui**: Component library integration
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **Supabase**: Real-time subscriptions for live UI updates

### Healthcare Domain Requirements

- **Patient Privacy**: All UI patterns must support LGPD compliance
- **Aesthetic Clinic Workflows**: Appointment booking, treatment tracking, consultation management
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Support for multiple clinics
- **Role-based Access**: Admin, doctor, staff, patient interfaces

### Component Categories to Document

1. **Patient Forms**: Registration, medical history, consent
2. **Scheduling Interfaces**: Calendar views, booking flows
3. **Treatment Tracking**: Progress visualization, photo comparisons
4. **Communication**: Chat interfaces, notification systems
5. **Dashboard Components**: Analytics, summaries, quick actions

### Real-time Requirements

- Live appointment updates using Supabase subscriptions
- Real-time patient queue status
- Live treatment progress tracking
- Instant communication updates

### Testing Standards

- Component testing with Testing Library
- Accessibility testing with axe-core
- Visual regression testing
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- Performance testing for real-time features

### File Structure Alignment

```
E:\neonpro\docs\front-end-spec.md (main document to complete)
E:\neonpro\apps\web\src\components\ (implementation reference)
E:\neonpro\packages\ui\ (shared component library)
```
