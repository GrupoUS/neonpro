## US-001: External Patient AI Chat FAQ Support

**User Type:** External Patient

**Story:** As a patient visiting the NeonPro clinic website, I want to chat with an AI assistant to get immediate answers to frequently asked questions about treatments, scheduling, and clinic policies, so that I can get the information I need 24/7 without waiting for business hours.

**Business Value:** Reduces administrative burden on staff by 40% while improving patient satisfaction through immediate response availability

### Acceptance Criteria:
- GIVEN a patient visits the clinic website, WHEN they click the chat widget, THEN an AI assistant interface opens with Portuguese greeting
- GIVEN a patient asks a FAQ question, WHEN the AI processes the query, THEN it provides accurate response within 2 seconds with 90%+ accuracy
- GIVEN the AI confidence level is below 85%, WHEN processing a patient query, THEN it automatically escalates to human support with context
- GIVEN a patient requests appointment scheduling, WHEN the AI processes the request, THEN it integrates with existing appointment system without breaking current functionality
- GIVEN conversation data is collected, WHEN stored, THEN it complies with LGPD requirements and patient consent protocols

### Integration Points:

**Existing Systems:**
- Current patient portal authentication system
- Existing appointment scheduling workflow
- LGPD compliance and audit logging system
- Current website navigation and UI components

**New Components:**
- AI Chat widget using shadcn/ui design system
- Portuguese language AI model integration
- Chat context caching system
- Automated escalation workflow

### Brownfield Constraints:
- **No Breaking Changes:** Chat widget must not interfere with existing website navigation or patient portal functionality
- **Performance Preservation:** Website load time must remain <2s with chat widget loaded
- **Data Compatibility:** Patient interaction data must integrate with existing patient records without schema changes
- **Rollback Capability:** Chat feature must be instantly disableable via feature flag without system disruption

### Technical Implementation:
- **Frontend:** React component integrated with existing Next.js layout, using current auth context
- **Backend:** New /api/ai/chat endpoint extending existing API structure
- **Database:** New chat_sessions and chat_messages tables with existing RLS policies
- **Caching:** Redis/Upstash integration for chat context with existing caching strategy

## US-002: Internal Staff Natural Language Database Queries

**User Type:** Healthcare Staff

**Story:** As a healthcare staff member using the NeonPro dashboard, I want to query patient information and practice data using natural Portuguese language, so that I can quickly access information without navigating through multiple screens or remembering complex search syntax.

**Business Value:** Reduces information retrieval time by 60% and enables non-technical staff to access complex data insights

### Acceptance Criteria:
- GIVEN a staff member is logged into the dashboard, WHEN they access the internal AI chat, THEN they see a staff-specific interface integrated with existing sidebar navigation
- GIVEN a staff member asks 'Mostre os agendamentos da Dra. Ana amanhÃ£', WHEN the AI processes the query, THEN it returns accurate appointment data from existing database
- GIVEN a query requires database access, WHEN the AI processes it, THEN it respects existing RLS policies and user permissions
- GIVEN a staff member requests patient information, WHEN displaying results, THEN it follows existing patient data display patterns and privacy controls
- GIVEN the AI cannot process a query, WHEN it fails, THEN it provides clear explanation and suggests alternative query formats

### Integration Points:

**Existing Systems:**
- Current staff authentication and role-based access control
- Existing database schema and RLS policies
- Current dashboard navigation and sidebar layout
- Staff permission system and audit logging

**New Components:**
- Natural language to SQL query translation engine
- Staff chat interface component
- Query result formatting system matching existing UI patterns
- Staff-specific AI training with healthcare terminology

### Brownfield Constraints:
- **Security Preservation:** All database queries must respect existing RLS policies and user permissions without modification
- **UI Consistency:** Staff chat interface must follow existing dashboard design patterns and navigation structure
- **Audit Compliance:** All AI-generated queries must integrate with existing audit logging without schema changes
- **Performance Requirements:** Database queries must maintain existing performance standards (<500ms)

## US-003: Proactive Patient No-Show Prevention Communication

**User Type:** Practice Manager

**Story:** As a practice manager, I want the AI system to proactively communicate with patients who have high no-show risk scores, so that I can prevent appointment cancellations and optimize practice revenue without manual intervention.

**Business Value:** Prevents $468,750+ annual revenue loss through 25% reduction in no-show rates with automated intervention

### Acceptance Criteria:
- GIVEN the ML model identifies a high no-show risk patient, WHEN 24-48 hours before appointment, THEN AI automatically sends personalized Portuguese SMS reminder
- GIVEN a patient responds to AI communication, WHEN they confirm or reschedule, THEN the system updates existing appointment records without breaking current workflow
- GIVEN multiple intervention strategies are available, WHEN selecting approach, THEN AI chooses strategy with highest success rate for that patient profile
- GIVEN AI interventions are sent, WHEN tracking results, THEN success metrics integrate with existing practice analytics dashboard
- GIVEN patient prefers phone contact, WHEN AI determines optimal timing, THEN it integrates with existing phone system or staff notification workflow

### Integration Points:

**Existing Systems:**
- Current appointment management and scheduling system
- Existing patient communication preferences and contact information
- Current SMS/notification infrastructure
- Practice analytics and reporting dashboard

**New Components:**
- ML no-show prediction model and scoring engine
- Automated intervention scheduling system
- Personalized message generation with Portuguese optimization
- Intervention success tracking and analytics

### Brownfield Constraints:
- **Appointment System Preservation:** All appointment modifications must use existing APIs without breaking current scheduling workflow
- **Patient Preference Respect:** Communication must respect existing patient communication preferences and consent settings
- **Staff Workflow Integration:** AI interventions must integrate with existing staff notification and follow-up processes
- **Data Consistency:** All intervention data must align with existing patient record structure

## Cross-Cutting Requirements

### Performance Standards:
- **Response Times:** AI chat responses <2s, database queries <500ms, ML predictions <1s
- **System Load:** No degradation of existing dashboard or website performance
- **Scalability:** Support 10x user growth without architecture changes

### Security & Compliance:
- **LGPD Compliance:** All AI data processing must comply with existing LGPD framework
- **Audit Trails:** AI decisions and interactions must integrate with existing audit logging
- **Data Encryption:** Chat and ML data must use existing encryption standards

### User Experience:
- **Consistency:** All AI interfaces must follow existing design system and navigation patterns
- **Accessibility:** AI components must meet existing WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Language Optimization:** All AI interactions optimized for Brazilian Portuguese healthcare terminology
