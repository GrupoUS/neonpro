## PHI Sanitization Patterns

### Automatic PHI Detection
```typescript
interface PHISanitizer {
  // Personal Identifiers
  removePersonalIdentifiers(text: string): string;
  // Medical Record Numbers
  sanitizeMedicalIds(text: string): string;
  // Dates (keep only relative timing)
  anonymizeDates(text: string): string;
  // Geographic Information
  removeGeographicInfo(text: string): string;
}
```

### Sanitization Rules
- **Names**: Replace with generic identifiers (Patient A, Doctor B)
- **Dates**: Convert to relative time periods (3 days ago, last week)
- **Medical IDs**: Replace with randomized identifiers
- **Addresses**: Remove or replace with geographic regions
- **Contact Info**: Complete removal of phone/email
- **Biometric Data**: Statistical summaries only

## Error Handling

### AI Service Failures
- **Service Unavailable**: 
  - Fallback: Manual workflow continuation
  - User Notice: "AI assistant temporarily unavailable"
  - Logging: Service outage with duration tracking

- **Invalid Response**:
  - Validation: Automatic response validation
  - Fallback: Request regeneration or manual process
  - Alert: Professional notified of AI processing issue

- **Rate Limiting**:
