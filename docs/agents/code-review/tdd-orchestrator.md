## Orchestration Workflows

### 1. Standard TDD Workflow

**Use Case**: Regular feature development with balanced quality focus

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Feature Request] --> B{Complexity Analysis}
    B -->|Low| C[Basic TDD Cycle]
    B -->|Medium| D[Enhanced TDD Cycle]
    B -->|High| E[Multi-Agent TDD Cycle]

    C --> F[test.md + code-reviewer.md]
    D --> G[+ architect-review.md]
    E --> H[+ security-auditor.md]

    F --> I[Quality Gates]
    G --> I
    H --> I
    I --> J[Deployment]
```

#### Execution Steps

1. **RED Phase Orchestration**

   ```yaml
   phase: RED
   primary_agent: test.md
   support_agents:
     - architect-review.md # Design test validation
     - security-auditor.md # Security test requirements (if triggered)

   actions:
     - Define test structure and patterns
     - Validate architectural test approach
     - Ensure security test coverage
     - Create failing tests (RED state)
   ```

2. **GREEN Phase Orchestration**

   ```yaml
   phase: GREEN
   primary_agent: code-reviewer.md
   support_agents:
     - architect-review.md # Pattern compliance
     - security-auditor.md # Vulnerability scanning
     - test.md # Test validation

   actions:
     - Implement minimal code to pass tests
     - Validate architectural patterns
     - Perform security analysis
     - Verify test success (GREEN state)
   ```

3. **REFACTOR Phase Orchestration**

   ```yaml
   phase: REFACTOR
   coordination: parallel_execution
   agents:
     - code-reviewer.md # Code quality improvements
     - architect-review.md # Design optimization
     - security-auditor.md # Security hardening
     - test.md # Test optimization

   actions:
     - Identify refactoring opportunities
     - Apply design improvements
     - Enhance security measures
     - Optimize test suite
   ```

### 2. Security-Critical TDD Workflow

**Use Case**: Authentication, payments, personal data handling

```yaml
workflow: "security-critical-tdd"
security_first: true
compliance_gates: ["GDPR", "PCI-DSS", "LGPD"]

phase_sequence:
  RED:
    primary: security-auditor
    secondary: [test, architect-review]
    focus: "Security test requirements definition"

  GREEN:
    primary: security-auditor
    secondary: [code-reviewer, test]
    focus: "Secure implementation with vulnerability prevention"

  REFACTOR:
    coordination: security-auditor
    agents: [code-reviewer, architect-review, test]
    focus: "Security hardening and compliance validation"
```

### 3. Microservices TDD Workflow

**Use Case**: Distributed systems, service boundaries, integration testing

```yaml
workflow: "microservices-tdd"
architecture_first: true
integration_focus: true

orchestration_pattern:
  service_boundary_analysis:
    agent: architect-review
    output: "Service contracts and boundaries"

  contract_testing:
    agent: test
    dependencies: [architect-review]
    output: "Contract tests and integration patterns"

  implementation_coordination:
    agents: [code-reviewer, security-auditor]
    parallel: true
    output: "Secure, quality implementation"
```

### 4. Legacy Code TDD Workflow

**Use Case**: Brownfield development, technical debt reduction

```yaml
workflow: "legacy-tdd"
safety_first: true
incremental_approach: true

phases:
  characterization:
    agents: [code-reviewer, test]
    goal: "Understand existing behavior"

  safety_net:
    agents: [test, architect-review]
    goal: "Create comprehensive test coverage"

  refactoring:
    coordination: architect-review
    agents: [code-reviewer, security-auditor, test]
    goal: "Safe incremental improvements"
```

## Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns

### 1. Sequential Delegation Pattern

**When to Use**: Linear dependencies, phase-based execution

```yaml
pattern: sequential
execution_order:
  1. architect-review    # Design validation
  2. security-auditor   # Security requirements
  3. test              # Test creation
  4. code-reviewer     # Implementation quality
```

### 2. Parallel Execution Pattern

**When to Use**: Independent analyses, time optimization

```yaml
pattern: parallel
concurrent_agents:
  analysis_group:
    - code-reviewer # Code quality
    - security-auditor # Security analysis
  validation_group:
    - architect-review # Design compliance
    - test # Test validation
```

### 3. Hierarchical Coordination Pattern

**When to Use**: Complex orchestration, master-slave relationships

```yaml
pattern: hierarchical
coordinator: tdd-orchestrator
sub_coordinators:
  quality_coordinator:
    agents: [code-reviewer, test]
    focus: "Quality assurance"

  security_coordinator:
    agents: [security-auditor]
    focus: "Security validation"

  architecture_coordinator:
    agents: [architect-review]
    focus: "Design compliance"
```

### 4. Event-Driven Activation Pattern

**When to Use**: Dynamic agent selection, context-sensitive activation

```yaml
pattern: event_driven
triggers:
  security_keywords: ["auth", "payment", "personal", "encrypt"]
  architecture_keywords: ["microservice", "api", "integration"]
  quality_keywords: ["performance", "refactor", "technical debt"]

activation_rules:
  if_security_detected:
    primary: security-auditor
    support: [code-reviewer, test]

  if_architecture_detected:
    primary: architect-review
    support: [code-reviewer, security-auditor]
```

## Communication & Integration Protocols

### Inter-Agent Communication

```yaml
COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL:
  message_format:
    sender: agent_name
    receiver: agent_name | "broadcast"
    type: "analysis" | "recommendation" | "validation"
    priority: "low" | "medium" | "high" | "critical"
    context:
      phase: "red" | "green" | "refactor"
      feature: string
      files: array
    payload: object

  shared_context:
    feature_spec: "Common understanding of requirements"
    code_changes: "Current implementation state"
    test_suite: "Test coverage and results"
    quality_metrics: "Code quality measurements"
    security_findings: "Vulnerabilities and compliance status"
```

### Agent State Management

```typescript
interface OrchestrationState {
  feature: {
    name: string;
    complexity: "low" | "medium" | "high";
    domain: string[];
    requirements: string[];
  };

  tdd_cycle: {
    phase: "red" | "green" | "refactor";
    iteration: number;
    test_status: "failing" | "passing" | "optimizing";
  };

  agents: {
    active: AgentName[];
    completed: AgentName[];
    pending: AgentName[];
    failed: AgentName[];
  };

  quality_gates: {
    architecture: QualityGateStatus;
    security: QualityGateStatus;
    code_quality: QualityGateStatus;
    test_coverage: QualityGateStatus;
  };
}
```

### Tool Integration Points

```yaml
INTEGRATION_POINTS:
  ci_cd_pipeline:
    github_actions:
      - trigger: "pull_request"
        workflow: "tdd-orchestration"
        agents: ["code-reviewer", "security-auditor"]

  ide_integration:
    vscode_extension:
      - command: "tdd.orchestrate"
        agents: ["test", "code-reviewer"]

    jetbrains_plugin:
      - action: "orchestrate_tdd_cycle"
        context: "current_feature"

```

## Decision Trees & Selection Logic

### Agent Selection Decision Tree

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Feature Analysis] --> B{Security Requirements?}
    B -->|Yes| C[security-auditor REQUIRED]
    B -->|No| D{Architecture Complexity?}

    C --> E{High Complexity?}
    E -->|Yes| F[+ architect-review]
    E -->|No| G[Standard security workflow]

    D -->|High| H[architect-review REQUIRED]
    D -->|Medium| I[code-reviewer + test]
    D -->|Low| J[test only]

    F --> K[Full orchestration]
    G --> L[Security-focused TDD]
    H --> M[Architecture-driven TDD]
    I --> N[Standard TDD]
    J --> O[Simple TDD]
```

### Workflow Selection Logic

```typescript
function selectWorkflow(feature: FeatureContext): WorkflowType {
  // Security-critical features
  if (hasSecurityRequirements(feature)) {
    return "security-critical-tdd";
  }

  // Architectural complexity
  if (feature.complexity === "high" || isDistributedSystem(feature)) {
    return "microservices-tdd";
  }

  // Legacy codebase
  if (isLegacyCode(feature.codebase)) {
    return "legacy-tdd";
  }

  // Default workflow
  return "standard-tdd";
}

function selectAgents(workflow: WorkflowType, phase: TDDPhase): Agent[] {
  const agentMatrix = {
    "standard-tdd": {
      red: ["test", "code-reviewer"],
      green: ["code-reviewer", "test"],
      refactor: ["code-reviewer", "architect-review", "test"],
    },
    "security-critical-tdd": {
      red: ["security-auditor", "test", "architect-review"],
      green: ["security-auditor", "code-reviewer", "test"],
      refactor: [
        "security-auditor",
        "code-reviewer",
        "architect-review",
        "test",
      ],
    },
    // ... other workflow mappings
  };

  return agentMatrix[workflow][phase];
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Orchestration Issues

| Issue                                | Symptoms                                              | Solution                                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent Coordination Conflicts**     | Multiple agents making contradictory recommendations  | Implement priority hierarchy and conflict resolution protocols |
| **Workflow Performance Degradation** | TDD cycles taking significantly longer                | Optimize agent selection and parallel execution patterns       |
| **Quality Gate Failures**            | Consistent failures in specific quality gates         | Review gate thresholds and agent effectiveness                 |
| **Context Loss Between Phases**      | Agents losing shared context during phase transitions | Strengthen state management and context persistence            |
| **Agent Selection Suboptimal**       | Wrong agents activated for feature type               | Refine trigger keywords and selection algorithms               |

### Debugging Orchestration Flows

```bash
# Enable orchestration debugging
export TDD_ORCHESTRATOR_DEBUG=true
export AGENT_COMMUNICATION_LOG=verbose

# Trace agent activation

# Validate agent coordination
tdd-orchestrator validate --agents="security-auditor,code-reviewer" --phase="green"

# Performance profiling
tdd-orchestrator profile --workflow="microservices-tdd" --iterations=10
```

### Agent Communication Diagnostics

```typescript
interface CommunicationDiagnostics {
  message_flow: {
    sent: number;
    received: number;
    failed: number;
  };

  coordination_issues: {
    conflicts: ConflictReport[];
    timeouts: TimeoutReport[];
    state_sync_failures: StateSyncError[];
  };

  performance_metrics: {
    average_response_time: number;
