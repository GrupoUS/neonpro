# TDD Orchestrator Implementation - CI/CD Integration Summary

## üéØ Phase 3: CI/CD Integration - COMPLETED

### üìã Overview
Successfully integrated comprehensive healthcare compliance testing into the CI/CD pipeline using the TDD orchestrator approach. The implementation includes enhanced GitHub Actions workflows, specialized compliance test scripts, and automated compliance auditing.

### üîß Key Components Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

- **Compliance test categories**: healthcare, security, regulatory compliance
- **Coverage reporting**: Integration with codecov for test coverage tracking
- **Graceful failure handling**: Non-critical build failures don't block compliance validation

#### 2. Enhanced Deploy Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- **Pre-deployment compliance checks**: Mandatory compliance validation before deployment
- **Post-deployment health checks**: Compliance endpoint validation and security headers verification
- **Deployment certificates**: Automated compliance certification generation
