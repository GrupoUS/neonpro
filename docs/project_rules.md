# 🚀 NEONPRO PROJECT RULES - Intelligent Context Loading & Project Excellence

**Philosophy**: "Context-aware engineering + Zero redundancy + Dynamic loading + Healthcare excellence"
**Approach**: Smart trigger detection → Dynamic rule loading → Optimal context assembly → Quality enforcement
**Performance**: <200ms context assembly + <5s complexity assessment + ≥95% context accuracy
**Context Engineering**: Intelligent triggers → Modular loading → Optimal assembly → Performance optimization

## 🧠 INTELLIGENT CONTEXT ENGINEERING SYSTEM

### **Dynamic Rule Loading Protocol**

```yaml
CONTEXT_ENGINEERING:
  orchestration_master: '#user_rules.md - Master orchestrator with complexity detection and agent routing'
  workflow_coordinator: '#workflow-mastery.md - Primary workflow execution and MCP coordination'
  quality_standards: '#unified-standards.md - Progressive quality enforcement (L1-L10)'
  project_context: 'This file - Context engineering and project-specific rules'

  intelligent_triggers:
    orchestration_needs: 'Auto-load #user_rules.md for complexity ≥L4 or agent coordination'
