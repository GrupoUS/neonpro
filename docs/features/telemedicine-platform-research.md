# Telemedicine Platform Research - WebRTC Healthcare Patterns

## Overview
Comprehensive research findings for implementing a WebRTC-based telemedicine platform in Brazil, ensuring compliance with CFM Resolution 2.314/2022, ANVISA regulations, and LGPD requirements.

## WebRTC Healthcare Implementation Patterns

### 1. Security and Encryption Requirements

**Built-in WebRTC Security:**
- **DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security)** - End-to-end encryption for data channels
- **SRTP (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol)** - Encrypted audio/video streams  
- **ICE/TURN/STUN** - Secure peer discovery and NAT traversal
- **Mandatory TLS 1.3** - All signaling server communications

**Healthcare-Specific Security Enhancements:**
- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)** with insertable streams for maximum privacy
- **Identity Verification** before session establishment
- **Session Recording Encryption** with separate keys per consultation
- **Audit Trail Encryption** with immutable logging

### 2. Architecture Patterns for Healthcare WebRTC

**Recommended Architecture: Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU)**
```
Doctor ‚Üê‚Üí Signaling Server ‚Üê‚Üí Patient
   ‚Üì           ‚Üì              ‚Üì
WebRTC SFU ‚Üê‚Üí Recording ‚Üê‚Üí Compliance
   ‚Üì           Server      Monitor
Audit Log ‚Üê‚Üí AI Triage ‚Üê‚Üí Session DB
```

**Key Components:**
- **Signaling Server** - Session establishment, ICE candidate exchange
- **Media Server/SFU** - Selective forwarding, recording, transcoding
- **Identity Provider** - CFM license validation, patient authentication
- **Audit Service** - LGPD-compliant logging and access tracking
- **AI Triage** - Symptom assessment and priority scoring

### 3. HIPAA/GDPR/LGPD Compliance Features

**Data Protection Requirements:**
- **Consent Management** - Granular permissions for recording, AI analysis
- **Data Minimization** - Only collect necessary PHI for consultation
- **Right to Erasure** - Secure deletion of consultation data upon request
- **Data Portability** - Export consultation records in standard format
- **Breach Notification** - Automated alerts within 72 hours

**Implementation Requirements:**
- **Geographic Data Residency** - Brazilian data centers only
- **Encryption at Rest** - AES-256 for stored recordings and metadata
- **Access Controls** - Role-based permissions with 2FA
- **Session Timeouts** - Automatic disconnection after inactivity
- **Watermarking** - Visible patient/doctor identification in recordings

## Technology Stack Recommendations

### WebRTC Libraries and Frameworks

**Primary Options:**
1. **Native WebRTC API** - Direct browser implementation
   - Pros: Maximum control, no dependencies
   - Cons: Complex implementation, cross-browser compatibility

2. **SimpleWebRTC/PeerJS** - Simplified WebRTC wrapper
   - Pros: Easier implementation, good documentation
   - Cons: Less flexibility, potential limitations

3. **Mediasoup** - Enterprise-grade SFU solution

// Example integration pattern
interface TelemedicineSession {
  sessionId: string;
  doctorId: string;
  patientId: string;
  recordingEnabled: boolean;
  triageScore?: number;
  complianceFlags: ComplianceFlags;
}

interface ComplianceFlags {
  cfmLicenseVerified: boolean;
  patientConsentObtained: boolean;
