# Feature Specification: AI Chat with Contextual Clinical & Financial Answers (Phase 1)

**Feature Branch**: `[phase1-ai-chat]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Initial AI chat capability that lets authorized clinic staff ask plain‑language questions about clinical and basic financial information, receive safe streaming answers, suggestions, and brief explanations while respecting consent, privacy and audit requirements. Phase 1 excludes multi‑model selection, advanced CRUD, and premium plan gating (added later)."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
2. Extract key concepts: chat, contextual answers (clinical + finance), consent, privacy, audit, safe suggestions, explanation summaries
3. Mark ambiguities: retention, consent validation mechanics, user roles granularity, rate limits
4. Populate user scenarios & testing
5. Generate functional requirements (testable, business-focused)
6. Identify key entities: User, Chat Session, Message, Suggestion, Explanation Summary, Consent Record, Audit Event
7. Review for implementation leakage (remove tech names / endpoints / code)
8. Output spec with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers where open
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A clinic staff member wants to quickly obtain a concise, privacy‑respecting answer about a patient’s recent treatments or outstanding balance by asking the system in natural language, without manually searching multiple internal systems.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the staff member has appropriate authorization and required consent is on record, **When** they submit a clear question about a patient’s recent treatments, **Then** the system returns a concise, contextually accurate textual answer and records an audit event.
2. **Given** the staff member asks a financial balance question for a patient with consent recorded, **When** the question is processed, **Then** the system returns the current outstanding balance phrased in understandable language and logs the interaction.
3. **Given** the staff member requests explanation/summary of an earlier answer, **When** they trigger explanation, **Then** the system produces a brief non‑sensitive summary without exposing protected identifiers.

### Edge Cases
- Missing consent for requested patient context → System refuses answer and states the reason (no sensitive details revealed).
- Ambiguous question referencing multiple patients → System requests clarification instead of guessing.
- Question includes disallowed personal identifiers → System redacts or declines with guidance.
- Rapid repeated queries exceeding fairness limits (more than 10 queries in 5 minutes or more than 30 queries in 1 hour per user) → System returns a polite rate‑limit style message indicating when to retry.
- Network or internal processing timeout → System returns a generic retry suggestion and logs failure.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-P1-001**: System MUST allow authorized staff to submit natural language questions about clinical or basic financial information.
- **FR-P1-002**: System MUST provide progressive answer visibility (incremental display of content within 1 second of first token) to reduce perceived latency.
- **FR-P1-003**: System MUST produce contextually relevant answers limited to permitted patient data scope.
- **FR-P1-004**: System MUST refuse or request clarification when a query is ambiguous regarding subject (e.g., multiple patients implied).
- **FR-P1-005**: System MUST enforce consent presence before including patient‑specific clinical or financial details.
- **FR-P1-006**: System MUST return a safe high‑level refusal message when consent is absent, without leaking protected data.
- **FR-P1-007**: System MUST provide automated follow‑up suggestion prompts (e.g., related clarifying questions) that avoid personal identifiers.
- **FR-P1-008**: System MUST offer a concise explanation/summary of an earlier answer that omits raw sensitive tokens.
- **FR-P1-009**: System MUST record an audit event for each answered (or refused) query capturing: eventId, userId, clinicId, timestampUTC, actionType, consentStatus, queryType (clinical|financial|explanation|suggestion|refusal), redactionApplied (boolean), outcome (success|refused|error), latencyMs, sessionId.
- **FR-P1-010**: System MUST redact protected identifiers (CPF, CNPJ, personal emails, phone numbers, full dates of birth, detailed street addresses beyond city/state, health insurance numbers) from any stored or displayed auxiliary logs.
- **FR-P1-011**: System MUST support basic clinical answer types (recent treatments overview) and basic financial answer types (current outstanding balance, overdue summary count + total).
- **FR-P1-012**: System MUST provide a generic error response template for internal errors without revealing internal stack details.
- **FR-P1-013**: System MUST indicate when data freshness exceeds 5 minutes (display a 'Data may be stale' notice).
- **FR-P1-014**: System MUST ensure only authorized roles (ADMIN, CLINICAL_STAFF, FINANCE_STAFF; SUPPORT_READONLY limited to read-only financial summaries) can invoke relevant queries.
- **FR-P1-015**: System SHOULD provide a user‑visible timestamp of when the answer generation started. (Optional value add)
- **FR-P1-016**: System MUST not expose implementation technology names in user answers.
- **FR-P1-017**: System MUST allow retrieval of prior session messages for continuity within a session lasting up to 60 minutes of inactivity (after which a new session starts).
- **FR-P1-018**: System MUST detect queries containing multiple intents and first ask the user to refine/select one intent before proceeding (no automatic splitting in Phase 1).
- **FR-P1-019**: System MUST provide localization hooks supporting at minimum `pt-BR` and `en-US` language selection.
- **FR-P1-020**: System MUST prevent inclusion of protected raw identifiers in generated suggestions or explanations.
- **FR-P1-021**: System MUST support a deterministic mock/test mode producing fixed outputs for: clinical summary, financial balance, overdue invoices summary, consent refusal scenario, and ambiguous query clarification request.
- **FR-P1-022**: System SHOULD surface a polite notification when rate or fairness limits trigger ("You’ve reached the temporary query limit—please retry in a few minutes").
- **FR-P1-023**: System MUST log refusals distinctly from successful answers for compliance analytics.
- **FR-P1-024**: System MUST retain audit events for a minimum of 5 years (configurable, minimum 2 years) to satisfy compliance requirements.

### Key Entities
- **User**: Authorized person initiating queries; associated with one or more clinics and roles.
- **Chat Session**: Logical grouping of user queries and system answers; supports continuity and context.
- **Message**: Individual user question or system answer element; may include redacted text markers.
- **Suggestion**: Follow‑up prompt proposed to guide user toward clarifying or related queries.
- **Explanation Summary**: Condensed, privacy‑filtered restatement of earlier answer’s rationale.
- **Consent Record**: Evidence that patient data usage is authorized; consulted before revealing details.
- **Audit Event**: Immutable record capturing query attempt (success or refusal) with metadata.
- **Rate / Fairness Counter**: Tracks recent usage volume for potential soft limiting.
