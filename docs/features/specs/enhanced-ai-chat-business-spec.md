# Feature Specification: Enhanced Multi-Model AI Business Assistant (Phase 2+)

**Feature Branch**: `[enhanced-ai-chat-multimodel]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Expanded AI assistant enabling multi‑model selection, business plan gating (free vs premium), natural language CRUD across Clients, Finance, and Agenda domains, cross‑domain analytical questions, upgrade prompts, and governed compliance (privacy, consent, audit, rate limits)."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description
2. Extract key concepts: multi-model, plan gating, natural language CRUD, cross-domain analytics, upgrade flow, compliance, usage limits
3. Mark ambiguities (rate limits, retention, failover UX, model list changes)
4. Build user scenarios & edge cases
5. Generate functional requirements (FR-EN-NNN)
6. Identify entities beyond Phase 1 additions
7. Validate absence of implementation specifics (no code / low-level protocol)
8. Output draft with clarification markers for stakeholder review
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A premium clinic administrator wants to ask a single natural language question that analyzes client engagement, recent appointment cancellations, and outstanding invoices, receiving an actionable consolidated answer with recommended follow‑up actions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a free plan user submits a query requiring a premium model, **When** they attempt the action, **Then** the system explains limitation and presents an unobtrusive upgrade prompt without completing the restricted operation.
2. **Given** a premium user requests to “update the appointment time for patient X from tomorrow 10am to 2pm,” **When** the system validates permissions and required consent, **Then** it confirms the change outcome in clear language.
3. **Given** a premium user asks a cross‑domain question (e.g., “Which clients overdue on payments also missed an appointment last month?”), **When** data is gathered, **Then** the system returns a unified list with summarized indicators without violating privacy boundaries.
4. **Given** an operation would exceed daily usage limits for a free plan, **When** the user issues the query, **Then** the system declines execution and provides remaining quota information (free quota: 40 read queries/day, 0 modifying operations).
5. **Given** a model becomes temporarily unavailable during answer generation, **When** failover occurs, **Then** the user is informed with a neutral notice: "Your answer was completed using an alternate processing tier."

### Edge Cases
- Attempted DELETE operation by free plan → blocked with upgrade rationale.
- Natural language CRUD instruction ambiguous (multiple potential targets) → clarification request before execution.
- Cross‑domain query requesting disallowed sensitive aggregation → refusal with compliance explanation.
- Excessive rapid CRUD modifications (potential abuse) → temporary soft limit notice. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: threshold + cooling period]
- Partial success (multi‑step CRUD where some sub‑actions fail) → summarized partial outcome with clear next steps.
- Time‑zone ambiguity in scheduling queries → system requests explicit date/time zone. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: default time zone policy]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-EN-001**: System MUST allow premium users to access higher‑tier reasoning model labels (MODEL_ADV_REASON, MODEL_SPEED, MODEL_ANALYTICS); free users restricted to MODEL_BASIC.
- **FR-EN-002**: System MUST enforce plan‑based feature gating for CRUD (create, update, delete) operations—read allowed for all within permitted data scope.
- **FR-EN-003**: System MUST support natural language CRUD verbs: create, read, update, delete across Clients, Finance, and Agenda domains (delete may be soft-delete for clients and appointments).
- **FR-EN-004**: System MUST provide a confirmation message after each executed CRUD operation summarizing change.
- **FR-EN-005**: System MUST request user clarification when a CRUD instruction is ambiguous (multiple entities match).
- **FR-EN-006**: System MUST provide cross‑domain analytical answers combining multiple data domains when user has necessary permissions.
- **FR-EN-007**: System MUST preserve privacy by excluding unnecessary personal identifiers from analytical summaries.
- **FR-EN-008**: System MUST present an upgrade prompt (non‑blocking) when a free user attempts a premium feature.
- **FR-EN-009**: System MUST track daily usage counts per user plan (read queries, modifying operations) and enforce limits; free: 40 read queries/day & 0 modify; premium: unlimited within abuse thresholds.
- **FR-EN-010**: System MUST display remaining daily usage to free users when usage reaches 80% of quota ("approaching limit") and upon limit exhaustion.
- **FR-EN-011**: System MUST support safe rollback messaging if an operation cannot fully complete (describe which sub‑actions succeeded vs failed).
- **FR-EN-012**: System MUST maintain an audit event for every CRUD action including actor, action type, timestampUTC, outcome, and retain for 5 years (configurable, minimum 2).
- **FR-EN-013**: System MUST fail gracefully if a preferred model is unavailable and transparently indicate a fallback was used (business wording only).
- **FR-EN-014**: System SHOULD provide aggregated performance time indicator (overall processing duration) with target p95 <= 5s for cross-domain analytics.
- **FR-EN-015**: System MUST prevent destructive operations (delete) on protected records when status indicates locked/finalized or regulatory hold.
- **FR-EN-016**: System MUST refuse operations lacking explicit patient consent where required.
- **FR-EN-017**: System MUST allow premium users to query historical trends across time windows up to 12 months.
- **FR-EN-018**: System MUST standardize date/time interpretation or request clarification when ambiguous.
- **FR-EN-019**: System MUST provide recommended next actions limited to: payment follow-up, scheduling optimization, client engagement outreach.
- **FR-EN-020**: System MUST apply rate/fairness controls: abuse defined as >12 queries in 60s OR >5 modifying operations in 10m; triggers 15m cool-down.
- **FR-EN-021**: System MUST support localization across `pt-BR`, `en-US`, and `es-ES` (Phase 2 adds es-ES).
- **FR-EN-022**: System MUST differentiate between read vs modifying requests, refusing modification for unauthorized roles.
- **FR-EN-023**: System MUST compile cross‑domain metrics without exposing raw underlying record identifiers (only aggregated descriptors).
- **FR-EN-024**: System MUST present clear error or refusal reasons with compliance framing (no technical jargon).
- **FR-EN-025**: System SHOULD surface upgrade benefit highlights contextually (standard phrasing library maintained by product marketing).
- **FR-EN-026**: System MUST enforce complexity threshold: if instruction implies >5 distinct entity modifications or >3 domains simultaneously, require user confirmation before execution.
- **FR-EN-027**: System MUST allow user to cancel an analytical request via a visible 'Cancel' control appearing if processing exceeds 2s.
- **FR-EN-028**: System MUST ensure all CRUD confirmations exclude sensitive internal IDs.
- **FR-EN-029**: System MUST track usage metrics taxonomy: queries.total, queries.read, queries.modify, upgrades.prompt_shown, upgrades.clicked, failovers.count, refusals.consent, refusals.permissions, latency.p95, usage.approaching_limit.
- **FR-EN-030**: System MUST support domain onboarding via registration of domain descriptor (name, operations, sensitivity classification) approved within 2 business days before exposure.

### Key Entities
- **Plan**: Defines user entitlements (model tiers, CRUD scope, daily limits).
- **Usage Counter**: Tracks per‑user daily actions (queries, CRUD) for gating logic.
- **Domain Object (Client / Finance Record / Appointment)**: Abstract business entities subject to CRUD and analytics.
- **Cross‑Domain Query**: Logical request spanning multiple domains producing synthesized output.
- **Recommendation**: Actionable follow‑up guidance derived from analytics.
- **Upgrade Prompt**: Contextual message presenting benefits and call to action for plan change.
- **Failover Notice**: User‑facing indication that a fallback model (non‑technical wording) handled the query.
- **Operation Confirmation**: Human‑readable summary of a completed modification.
- **Partial Outcome Report**: Structured message summarizing partial success/failure states.
