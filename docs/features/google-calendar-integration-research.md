2. **Error Handling & Rate Limiting**
   - **Default Quotas**: 100 requests per user per 100 seconds
   - **Daily Limit**: 1 million requests per project (free tier)
   - **Exponential Backoff**: Mandatory for rate limit errors
   - **Caching Strategies**: Reduce API calls and improve performance
   - **Batch Operations**: Combine multiple requests when possible

3. **Implementation Patterns**

export class GoogleCalendarService {
  private calendar: google.calendar_v3.Calendar;

  constructor(auth: any) {
    this.calendar = google.calendar({ version: "v3", auth });
  }

  async createEvent(eventData: {
    summary: string;
    start: Date;
    end: Date;
    description?: string;
    attendees?: string[];
    location?: string;
  }) {
    const event = {
      summary: eventData.summary,
      description: eventData.description,
      location: eventData.location,
      start: {
        dateTime: eventData.start.toISOString(),
        timeZone: "America/Sao_Paulo",
      },
      end: {
        dateTime: eventData.end.toISOString(),
        timeZone: "America/Sao_Paulo",
      },
      attendees: eventData.attendees?.map((email) => ({ email })),
    };

    try {
      const response = await this.calendar.events.insert({
        calendarId: "primary",
        requestBody: event,
      });
      return response.data;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error creating event:", error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

### Incremental Sync Implementation

```typescript
export class CalendarSyncService {
  private syncToken: string | null = null;
  private readonly calendar: google.calendar_v3.Calendar;

  async performIncrementalSync() {
    try {
      const request = this.calendar.events.list({
        calendarId: "primary",
        syncToken: this.syncToken || undefined,
        singleEvents: true,
        orderBy: "startTime",
      });

      const response = await this.executeWithRetry(request);

      // Process events
      for (const event of response.data.items || []) {
        await this.processEvent(event);
      }

      // Update sync token
      this.syncToken = response.data.nextSyncToken;
      await this.saveSyncToken(this.syncToken);

      return response.data.items?.length || 0;
    } catch (error: any) {
      if (error.code === 410) {
        // Sync token expired, perform full sync
        return this.performFullSync();
      }
      throw error;
    }
  }

  private async executeWithRetry(request: any, maxRetries = 3) {
    let lastError: any;

    for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
      try {
        return await request;
      } catch (error: any) {
        lastError = error;

        if (error.code === 429 || error.code === 403) {
          // Rate limited, implement exponential backoff
          const delay = Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000;
          await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
          continue;
        }

        // Non-retryable error
        throw error;
      }
    }

    throw lastError;
  }
}
```
