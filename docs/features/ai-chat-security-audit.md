## Security Architecture Review

### 1. Authentication & Authorization ✅

**Multi-Layer Security**:

- ✅ JWT-based authentication with secure token handling
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) at database level
- ✅ Application-level authorization checks
- ✅ Session management with automatic expiration

**Access Control**:

```sql
-- Verified RLS policies provide clinic-level isolation
CREATE POLICY ai_chat_sessions_user_access ON ai_chat_sessions
    FOR ALL USING (
        user_id = auth.uid() AND
        clinic_id = get_user_clinic_id(auth.uid())
    );
```

**Security Strengths**:

- Defense in depth with database and application layers
- Proper session timeout (1 hour default)
- Secure token validation and refresh mechanisms

### 2. Data Protection & Privacy ✅

**LGPD Compliance**:

- ✅ Automatic PII detection and redaction
- ✅ Comprehensive audit logging
- ✅ Consent validation before processing
- ✅ Data retention policies with automatic cleanup
- ✅ Right to erasure implementation

**PII Protection Verification**:

```typescript
// Verified redaction for Brazilian PII types
const testData = "João Silva, CPF 123.456.789-01, tel (11) 99999-9999";
const redacted = redactPII(testData);
// Result: "[REDACTED], CPF [REDACTED], tel [REDACTED]"
```

**Encryption Standards**:

- ✅ TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- ✅ AES-256 for data at rest (Supabase native)
- ✅ Secure key management
- ✅ End-to-end encryption for sensitive operations

### 3. Input Validation & Injection Prevention ✅

**Validation Layers**:

- ✅ Valibot schema validation at API boundary
- ✅ Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
- ✅ Content sanitization for XSS prevention
- ✅ File upload restrictions (future-ready)

**Injection Testing Results**:

```sql
-- SQL Injection Test: BLOCKED ✅
-- Input: "'; DROP TABLE ai_chat_sessions; --"
-- Result: Parameterized query safely handles malicious input

-- XSS Test: BLOCKED ✅
-- Input: "<script>alert('xss')</script>"
-- Result: Content sanitization removes harmful scripts
```

### 4. Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection ✅

**Multi-Level Rate Limiting**:

- ✅ Per-user limits: 60/minute, 500/hour
- ✅ Per-clinic limits: 1000/minute, 5000/hour
- ✅ Provider-specific limits with backoff
- ✅ Graceful degradation under load

**Attack Vector Protection**:

```typescript
// Rate limiting implementation verified
const userLimit = new RateLimiter({
  windowMs: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
  max: 60, // 60 requests per minute
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false,
});
```

### 5. Content Safety & Medical Ethics ✅

**Content Filtering**:

- ✅ Medical context validation
- ✅ Professional boundary enforcement
- ✅ Harmful content detection
- ✅ CFM compliance verification

**Safety Measures**:
