## 🔧 Integration Recommendations

### High Priority (Production Critical)

1. **Integrate HealthcareQueryOptimizer**: Connect the advanced query optimizer to main services
2. **Upgrade to Redis Cache**: Replace in-memory cache with distributed Redis
3. **Implement Explicit Lazy Loading**: Add React.lazy and Suspense for route-based code splitting
4. **Background Job Optimization**: Implement job queue with proper error handling and retry logic

### Medium Priority (Performance Enhancement)

1. **Database Connection Pooling**: Optimize database connections for high load
2. **CDN Configuration**: Set up Brazilian edge locations for static assets
