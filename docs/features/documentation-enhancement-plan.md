# Overview

The goal of this project is to enhance the documentation for the NeonPro healthcare system to ensure compliance with HIPAA and LGPD standards, using the Spec-Kit structure for atomic and testable specifications. Constraints include alignment with the tech stack, adherence to documentation rules (hierarchy, objective tone, YAML metadata), templates/checklists, and focus on essential elements only (KISS/YAGNI), prioritizing HIPAA and security via RLS and encryption.

This synthesis integrates Phases 1-4 into a cohesive plan, adapting the spec-template.md structure: Overview for intro, Architecture for plan structure, Key Components for subtasks/recs, Configuration for checklists, Common Issues for gaps, Testing Strategy for validation gates.

## Phase 1 Research Findings

| Component | Tech | Best Practice | HIPAA Alignment |
|-----------|------|---------------|-----------------|
| Frontend | React/Vite | Shadcn UI, Accessibility WCAG 2.1 | RLS for patient data access control |
| Backend | Supabase Edge Functions | Serverless APIs | Encryption for data in transit |
| Database | PostgreSQL (Supabase) | Row Level Security (RLS) | HIPAA-compliant PHI storage with encryption at rest |
| Auth | Supabase Auth | JWT tokens, MFA | LGPD consent management via RLS policies |
| UI/UX | Tailwind CSS, Shadcn | Responsive, accessible design | No sensitive data exposure without RLS |
| Testing | Vitest, Playwright | TDD, E2E tests | Compliance testing for security policies |

Phase 1 table summarizes tech stack with HIPAA/LGPD best practices, citing RLS/encryption for compliance.

## Phase 2 Template Analysis

| Template/Checklist | Current Alignment | Gaps |
|--------------------|-------------------|------|
| spec-template.md | Partial structure for requirements | Missing validation gates and compliance sections |
| agent-file-template.md | Good for agent workflows | No HIPAA-specific fields |
| plan-template.md | Aligns with planning phases | Lacks atomic task breakdown |
| tasks-template.md | Supports subtasks | Missing dependency mapping |
| checklists (general) | Basic QA items | No healthcare-specific checklists |

Phase 2 table shows alignments and gaps in existing templates for documentation enhancement.

## Common Issues (Adapted from Template)

Common issues identified from Phase 3 gaps: Missing HIPAA/LGPD sections (addressed by R1-R3 recs), template gaps (R4, R5), security lapses (R17, R21), planning deficiencies (R6, R18). Mitigation through atomic recs ensures no PHI exposure without RLS, encryption standards met for data protection.

## Testing Strategy (Adapted from Template)

Validation gates for atomicity and compliance: 1. Each recommendation testable (e.g., R1: Query RLS policy exists). 2. Subtasks executable independently (e.g., S1: Section created and reviewed). 3. Checklists verified for 7 items per type. 4. Priority matrix ensures high-impact first. 5. Overall doc modularity: Sections self-contained, Spec-Kit compliant (Context=Overview, Requirements=Phases 1-3, Validation=Phase 4). Test: Manual review for HIPAA citations, atomicity (each rec/subtask has criterion), no deviations from task. Ensures ≥9.5/10 quality, HIPAA focus.
