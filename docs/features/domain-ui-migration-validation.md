# Domain → UI Migration Validation ✅ COMPLETED

This document records the **COMPLETED** migration of `@neonpro/domain` into `@neonpro/ui`. The proxy package has been fully removed and all references updated.

## Goals

- Maintain backward compatibility via proxy exports
- Ensure no missing exports and no circular dependencies
- Keep type-check green across monorepo
- Fix failing unit/integration tests
- Document evidence and provide sign-off checklist

## Evidence Summary

- Full Code Check: PASS (0 errors, warnings only)
- Unit tests: PASS (206/206)
- Integration tests: PASS
- Format: PASS (dprint formatted 3 files)
- Lint: 1362 warnings, 0 errors (mostly unused vars/imports). Non-blocking for MVP.

## Changes made

- Replaced forbidden non-null assertions in compliance/dashboard components with safe access
- Fixed UI tests:
  - Button: align props and className merge
  - Card + subcomponents: render children correctly
  - Form: provider and defaultValues fixes
- Verified domain → ui proxies and exports coverage; no circular deps detected

## Commands Run

```bash
# Lint auto-fix
npx oxlint --fix .

# Full code check (format check + lint + typecheck)
bash -c "npx dprint check && npx oxlint . && npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck"

# Format
npx dprint fmt

# Tests
pnpm vitest run --reporter=verbose
```

## Remaining Warnings (non-blocking)

- Numerous no-unused-vars/imports in test and mock-heavy compliance modules
- Some unicorn/react rules flagged; defer to post-MVP clean-up task

## Sign-off Checklist

- [x] Type-checks green (no TS errors)
- [x] Unit/Integration tests green
- [x] UI proxy re-exports validated
- [x] No circular dependencies detected
- [x] Docs updated (this file)

## ✅ Migration Completed (2025-09-06)

**Final Status**: The `@neonpro/domain` package has been **completely removed** from the codebase. All functionality has been successfully consolidated into `@neonpro/ui`.

### Changes Made:

1. ✅ Updated import in `apps/web/components/dashboard/healthcare-dashboard.tsx`
2. ✅ Removed `packages/domain` directory completely
3. ✅ Updated build configurations (turbo.json, next.config.mjs, tsup.config.ts)
4. ✅ Added `useHealthcarePermissions` export to `@neonpro/ui`
5. ✅ Validated TypeScript compilation and linting
6. ✅ Updated all documentation references

### Validation Results:

- ✅ TypeScript compilation: PASS
- ✅ Linting: PASS (warnings unrelated to migration)
- ✅ UI package build: PASS
- ✅ No breaking changes to external consumers
