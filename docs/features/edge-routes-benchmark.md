# Edge Routes Benchmark Results

## Overview

This document contains the results of the Edge routes benchmarking task (task 26 from Phase 2 todo list). The benchmark was conducted to measure the Time to First Byte (TTFB) performance of all Edge routes.

## Benchmark Configuration

- **Tool**: Custom Node.js benchmark script
- **Concurrent requests per route**: 100
- **Target TTFB**: <150ms P95
- **Server**: Local Node.js server on port 3000
- **Database**: Supabase remote instance
- **Date**: 2025-09-30

## Results Summary

### Overall Performance
- **Target TTFB**: <150ms P95
- **Overall P95**: 935.14ms ❌
- **Routes under target**: 7/8 (87.5%)
- **Success rate**: 87.5%

## Analysis

### Successful Routes

7 out of 8 routes met the performance target of <150ms P95:

1. **/health**: Excellent performance with P95 of 7.77ms
2. **/package-manager/config**: Excellent performance with P95 of 8.43ms
3. **/migration/state**: Excellent performance with P95 of 8.29ms
4. **/realtime/status**: Excellent performance with P95 of 8.87ms
5. **/performance/metrics**: Good performance with P95 of 11.13ms
6. **/compliance/status**: Good performance with P95 of 11.41ms
7. **/migration/start**: Acceptable performance with P95 of 19.77ms

### Route Requiring Optimization

1. **/architecture/config**: Poor performance with P95 of 935.14ms (6.2x over target)
   - This route is significantly slower than all other routes
   - The high variance (Min: 18.80ms, Max: 984.66ms) suggests inconsistent performance
   - This route likely has a performance bottleneck that needs investigation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Optimize /architecture/config endpoint**:
   - Investigate the cause of the high latency
   - Implement caching for this endpoint
   - Consider optimizing the database query or response structure
   - Add performance monitoring to identify bottlenecks

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Implement caching strategy**:
   - Add response caching for frequently accessed data
   - Consider edge caching for static configuration data

2. **Performance monitoring**:
   - Set up continuous performance monitoring
   - Implement alerts for performance regressions
   - Track performance metrics over time

3. **Database optimization**:
   - Review database indexes for frequently queried tables
   - Consider database connection pooling
   - Optimize query performance

## Phase 1 Comparison

No Phase 1 data was available for comparison. The current benchmark establishes a baseline with:
- **Baseline P95**: 935.14ms
- **Target improvement**: 3-5x speed

## Database Logging

Attempts to log benchmark results to the performance_metrics table failed due to schema cache issues. The additional_metadata column exists in the database but is not recognized by the Supabase API. This issue needs to be resolved for future benchmark logging.

## Conclusion

The Edge routes benchmark shows mixed results:
- 7 out of 8 routes meet the performance target
- 1 route (/architecture/config) requires significant optimization
- Overall performance is acceptable but needs improvement

The benchmark establishes a baseline for future performance improvements and identifies specific areas for optimization.

## Next Steps

1. Fix the database logging issue for performance metrics
2. Optimize the /architecture/config endpoint
3. Implement caching strategies
4. Set up continuous performance monitoring
5. Re-run benchmarks after optimizations
