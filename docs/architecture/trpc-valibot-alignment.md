# tRPC + Valibot Alignment (Web App)

Goal: Keep apps/web type-check green while preparing a safe path to typed API/validation.

## Decisions

- Keep TRPCProvider as a no-op stub until backend router types stabilize.
- Provide a minimal client shim that avoids importing router types to prevent type collisions.
- Replace zod with Valibot only when necessary (no big-bang migration). Follow KISS/YAGNI.

## Implemented

- src/lib/trpcClient.ts
  - `createTRPCClientShim()` â†’ returns `{ query, mutation }` no-ops
  - `trpcClient` singleton for convenience in non-critical places
- Zod enums previously using deprecated patterns were simplified (errorMap removed). No further changes needed now.

## Next Steps

1. Stabilize backend router contracts (tRPC v11) and expose a small, stable public client surface.
2. Gradually wire the shim to real client methods (per domain) without importing router types in the web app.
3. For schemas actively used in apps/web, convert brittle zod constructs to Valibot one-by-one.
4. Keep type-check green after each incremental change; revert if change causes cascading errors.

## Notes

- This alignment intentionally avoids deep type coupling between apps/web and server routers.
- Prefer functional boundaries with narrow interfaces (domain adapters) to prevent type explosion.
