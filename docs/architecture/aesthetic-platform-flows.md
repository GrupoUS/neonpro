## Core Platform Flows

### 1. User Authentication & Authorization Flow

**Purpose**: Secure access control for clients, aesthetic professionals, and clinic administrators

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Access] --> B{User Type}
    B -->|Client| C[Client Login]
    B -->|Professional| D[Professional Login]
    B -->|Admin| E[Admin Login]

    C --> F[Phone/Email + Password]
    D --> G[Professional License + Password]
    E --> H[Admin Credentials]

    F --> I[LGPD Data Processing]
    G --> J[License Verification]
    H --> K[Admin Permissions]

    I --> L[Client Dashboard]
    J --> M[Professional Dashboard]
    K --> N[Admin Dashboard]

    style I fill:#e3f2fd
    style J fill:#fff3e0
    style K fill:#e8f5e8
```

**Implementation Example**:

```typescript
// auth-flow.ts
export const authenticateUser = async (credentials: UserCredentials) => {
  const { userType, identifier, password } = credentials;

  switch (userType) {
    case 'client':
      return await authenticateClient(identifier, password);
    case 'professional':
      return await authenticateProfessional(identifier, password);
    case 'admin':
      return await authenticateAdmin(identifier, password);
  }
};
```

**Procedure**:

1. **User Type Detection** - System identifies user role (client/professional/admin)
2. **Credential Validation** - Role-specific authentication (email/phone, professional license, admin credentials)
3. **LGPD Compliance** - Data processing consent verification for clients
4. **Session Creation** - Generate secure session with appropriate permissions
5. **Dashboard Routing** - Navigate to role-specific dashboard interface

### 2. Client Registration & Onboarding Flow

**Purpose**: Streamlined client onboarding with LGPD compliance and aesthetic treatment history

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant W as Web App
    participant L as LGPD Engine
    participant DB as Database
    participant N as Notification System

    C->>W: Start registration
    W->>L: Check LGPD requirements
    L->>W: Present consent forms
    W->>C: LGPD consent interface
    C->>W: Provide consent + basic info
    W->>DB: Store consent + create profile
    DB->>W: Client ID created
    W->>C: Aesthetic history form
    C->>W: Complete treatment history
    W->>DB: Store treatment data
    DB->>N: Trigger welcome sequence
    N->>C: Welcome WhatsApp + next steps
```

**Procedure**:

1. **Registration Initiation** - Client starts registration process
2. **LGPD Compliance Check** - System presents required consent forms
3. **Consent Collection** - Client provides consent for data processing
4. **Basic Information** - Collect personal details (name, contact info, address)
5. **Aesthetic History** - Gather previous treatments, preferences, goals
6. **Profile Creation** - Generate client profile with unique ID
7. **Welcome Sequence** - Send confirmation via WhatsApp with next steps

**Implementation Example**:

```typescript
// client-registration.ts
export const registerClient = async (clientData: ClientRegistrationData) => {
  const { personalInfo, aestheticHistory, preferences } = clientData;

  // LGPD compliance check
  const consentValid = await validateLGPDConsent(clientData.consents);

  if (!consentValid) {
    throw new Error('LGPD consent required');
  }

  // Create client profile
  const client = await db.clients.create({
    data: {
      ...personalInfo,
      aestheticHistory,
      preferences,
      consents: clientData.consents,
    },
  });

  // Send WhatsApp welcome message

    include: { client: true, professional: true },
  });

  // Calculate risk score
  const riskScore = await calculateNoShowRisk(appointment);

  // Deploy communication strategy based on risk
  const communicationStrategy = getCommunicationStrategy(riskScore);

  // Send WhatsApp reminders
  await sendWhatsAppReminders(appointment, communicationStrategy);
