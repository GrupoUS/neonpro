# MCP Testing Results

## Test Summary

Tested all MCP servers configured in the project to verify connectivity and functionality.

## Results

### ✅ Working MCPs

#### 1. sequential-thinking

- **Status**: Working correctly
- **Test Result**: Successfully processed sequential thinking requests
- **Response**: Returned proper thought structure with thoughtNumber, totalThoughts, and thoughtHistoryLength

#### 2. context7

- **Status**: Working correctly
- **Test Result**: Successfully resolved library IDs and returned search results
- **Response**: Returned comprehensive list of test-related libraries with metadata including trust scores and code snippets
- **Note**: Requires both libraryId and libraryName parameters

### ❌ Not Configured MCPs

#### 3. shadcn

- **Status**: Not configured
- **Error**: Server 'shadcn' is not configured
- **Available Servers**: context7, filesystem, tavily, sequentialthinking

#### 4. archon

- **Status**: Not configured
- **Error**: Server 'archon' is not configured
- **Available Servers**: context7, filesystem, tavily, sequentialthinking

#### 5. desktop-commander

- **Status**: Not configured
- **Error**: Server 'desktop-commander' is not configured
- **Available Servers**: context7, filesystem, tavily, sequentialthinking

#### 6. serena

- **Status**: Not configured
- **Error**: Server 'serena' is not configured
- **Available Servers**: context7, filesystem, tavily, sequentialthinking

### ⚠️ Connection Issues

#### 7. tavily

- **Status**: Connection error
- **Error**: MCP error -32000: Connection closed
- **Issue**: The server connection is closing during execution
- **Note**: Server is configured but experiencing connectivity issues

## Recommendations

1. **Configure Missing MCPs**: The following MCPs need to be configured in the MCP settings:
   - shadcn
   - archon
   - desktop-commander
   - serena

2. **Fix Tavily Connection**: Investigate and resolve the connection issue with the tavily MCP server.

3. **Update MCP Configuration**: Ensure all required MCPs are properly configured in the project's MCP settings file.

## Impact on Development Workflow

The current MCP configuration significantly impacts the development workflow:

- **Sequential-thinking** and **context7** are working, enabling basic research and thinking capabilities.
- Missing critical MCPs like **archon** (task management), **serena** (codebase analysis), and **desktop-commander** (file operations) prevent full workflow execution.
- The **tavily** connection issue affects web search capabilities for research.

## Next Steps

1. Configure the missing MCP servers in the project settings
2. Resolve the tavily connection issue
3. Re-test all MCPs to ensure full functionality
4. Update documentation with proper MCP configuration instructions
