# 📚 Documentation Orchestrator (docs/) — v2

Central guide for humans and LLMs to navigate the entire `docs/` folder with maximum efficiency and precision.

## ⚡ Quick Start for LLMs

1. Read the prerequisites (see front matter: `llm.pre_read`)
2. Follow the mandatory sequence: thinking → tasks → codebase analysis (`llm.mandatory_sequence`)
3. Use the `llm_index` to prioritize folders by domain
4. Apply the Diátaxis framework when consuming content: Tutorial → How-to → Reference → Explanation
5. When finished, execute the Memory Protocol (see `docs/memory.md`)

## 🔎 How to Use (Humans)

- Start with the per-area orchestrators (links below)
- Read the folder guide before editing any internal file
- Return here when you need to discover where content lives

## 🧭 Orchestrated Navigation (by Folder)

- Architecture: `docs/architecture/AGENTS.md` → System and frontend architecture, source tree, stack
  - Link: [./architecture/AGENTS.md](./architecture/AGENTS.md)
- Database Schema: `docs/database-schema/AGENTS.md` → Schema rules and inventory, tables and RLS
  - Link: [./database-schema/AGENTS.md](./database-schema/AGENTS.md)
- APIs: `docs/apis/AGENTS.md` → Documentation standards for endpoints + AI SDK
  - Link: [./apis/AGENTS.md](./apis/AGENTS.md)
- Agents: `docs/agents/AGENTS.md` → Agent system (apex-dev, researcher, ui-ux, test, etc.)
  - Link: [./agents/AGENTS.md](./agents/AGENTS.md)

Fundamental documents:

- Project Memory: [./memory.md](./memory.md)
- Coding Standards: [./rules/coding-standards.md](./rules/coding-standards.md)

## 🧭 Navigation Matrix for LLMs (Machine-readable)

```yaml
navigation_matrix:
  tasks:
    - goal: "Implement a feature or fix a bug"
      consult:
        - docs/agents/AGENTS.md
        - docs/rules/coding-standards.md
        - docs/architecture/source-tree.md
        - docs/memory.md
    - goal: "Create/update an API"
      consult:
        - docs/apis/AGENTS.md
        - docs/apis/apis.md
        - docs/rules/variables-configuration.md
        - docs/testing/integration-testing.md
    - goal: "Modify schema/tables (Supabase)"
      consult:
        - docs/database-schema/AGENTS.md
        - docs/database-schema/database-schema-consolidated.md
        - docs/database-schema/tables/tables-consolidated.md
        - docs/rules/supabase-best-practices.md
    - goal: "Add tests (unit/integration/e2e)"
      consult:
        - docs/testing/coverage-policy.md
        - docs/testing/react-test-patterns.md
        - docs/testing/integration-testing.md
        - docs/testing/e2e-testing.md
```

## Pre-Development Guidelines

**📚 Documentation Consultation:**
⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Only consult documentation when you have specific questions or uncertainties. Avoid loading unnecessary context.

- agents/ — Orchestrator: [./agents/AGENTS.md](./agents/AGENTS.md)
  - Key documents: apex-dev, apex-researcher, apex-ui-ux-designer, test, prd, briefing, documentation, rules

- Check architecture/ — Orchestrator for architectural decisions: [./architecture/AGENTS.md](./architecture/AGENTS.md)
  - Review `docs/tech-stack.md` for technology guidelines
  - Key documents: architecture, source-tree, frontend-architecture, front-end-spec, tech-stack, aesthetic-platform-flows

- Check database-schema/ — Orchestrator for data structure: [./database-schema/AGENTS.md](./database-schema/AGENTS.md)
  - Key documents: database-schema-consolidated, tables/README, tables/tables-consolidated
- Look at apis/ — Orchestrator for API patterns: [./apis/AGENTS.md](./apis/AGENTS.md)
  - Key documents: apis, ai-sdk-v5.0, ai-sdk-v4.0
- **Code Style:** Follow established patterns and conventions from development rules and guidelines found in the `/rules` directory — Standards: coding-standards, supabase-*, variables-configuration
- Check testing/ — Tests: react-test-patterns, e2e-testing, integration-testing, coverage-policy, ci-pipelines
- Check prd/ — Product: prd and support files
- Check mistakes/ — Errors and fixes

## Mandatory Development Steps

### **Planning & Task List**

- Create a detailed task list using the todo tool to implement the feature
- Break down complex features into manageable subtasks
- Mark tasks as in_progress when starting, completed when finished

## 🏷️ Metadata and Tagging (Recommended)

Add simple front matter to primary files:

```yaml
---
title: "Document Name"
last_updated: 2025-09-02
form: reference   # tutorial | how-to | reference | explanation
tags: [agents, testing, supabase]
related:
  - ./AGENTS.md
  - ../rules/coding-standards.md
---
```

Benefits: better retrieval (RAG), maintenance, and cross-navigation.

## 🔗 Cross-referencing and Links

- Use consistent relative links: `[Text](./path/file.md)`
- Include a “See also” block with 3–5 relevant links
- Maintain stable section anchors (English, kebab-case)
- At the top of each file, include a link back to this orchestrator

“See also” model:

```markdown
> See also: [Docs Orchestrator](../AGENTS.md) · [Coding Standards](../rules/coding-standards.md) · [Memory](../memory.md)
```

## ✅ Update & Memory Protocol

- When behavior/contracts change: update related docs
- Log errors/fixes in `docs/mistakes/`
- Update `docs/features/` if you create/alter a feature
- Re-evaluate “See also” links and `tags`
- Follow `docs/memory.md` (Memory Protocol)

## 🗒️ Complete Inventory (Summary)

Refer to the previous version’s “Complete Inventory” section or search within `docs/`.
