## Development Rules & Constitutional Principles

### VIBECODER Core Philosophy

**Mantra:** _"Think → Research → Decompose → Plan → Implement → Validate"_
**Mission:** "Research first, think systematically, implement flawlessly with constitutional excellence"
**Core Principle:** "Simple systems that work over complex systems that don't"

#### Constitutional Engineering Principles

**KISS Principle (Keep It Simple):**

- Choose simplest solution that meets requirements
- Prefer readable code over clever optimizations
- Use clear, descriptive naming conventions
- Reduce cognitive load and avoid over-engineering

**YAGNI Principle (You Aren't Gonna Need It):**

- Build only what current requirements specify
- Resist 'just in case' features and premature optimization
- Refactor when requirements emerge
- Remove unused code immediately

**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

- Break problems into sequential logical steps
- Verbalize reasoning process with explicit documentation
- Show intermediate decisions and validate against requirements
- Each step follows logically from previous steps

### Mandatory Archon Task Management Workflow

**CRITICAL:** This project uses Archon MCP for knowledge management, task tracking, and project organization.

**Mandatory Task Cycle (Complete Before Any Coding):**

1. **Check Current Task** → Review task details and requirements via Archon
2. **Research for Task** → Search relevant documentation and examples
3. **Implement the Task** → Write code based on research findings
4. **Update Task Status** → Move task: "todo" → "doing" → "review" → "done"
5. **Get Next Task** → Check Archon for next priority task
6. **Repeat Cycle** → Continue systematic task completion

**Task Management Rules:**

- Update all actions to Archon with detailed progress notes
- Never skip the research phase for complex implementations
- Maintain comprehensive task descriptions with implementation notes
- DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS - always check project documentation
