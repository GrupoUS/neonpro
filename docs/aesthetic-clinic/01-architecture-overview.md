```

#### 2. Relationships & Constraints

```sql
-- Foreign key relationships for data integrity
ALTER TABLE AestheticSession
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_session_client
FOREIGN KEY (client_id) REFERENCES AestheticClientProfile(id);

ALTER TABLE AestheticSession
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_session_professional
FOREIGN KEY (professional_id) REFERENCES AestheticProfessional(id);

ALTER TABLE AestheticAppointment
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_appointment_treatment
FOREIGN KEY (treatment_id) REFERENCES AestheticTreatmentCatalog(id);
```

### Frontend Architecture

#### 1. Component Structure

```typescript
// Aesthetic clinic specific components

```

#### 2. State Management

```typescript
// Global state for aesthetic clinic
interface AestheticClinicState {
  clients: AestheticClientProfile[];
  treatments: AestheticTreatmentCatalog[];
