# TanStack Router Vercel Deployment Fix

## Issue Summary
Dashboard and other routes were returning 404 errors in Vercel production deployment while working correctly in local development.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the Vercel configuration file (`vercel.json`). The configuration had conflicting properties that prevented proper SPA (Single Page Application) routing:

- `cleanUrls: true`
- `trailingSlash: false` 
- Combined with `rewrites: [...]`

When these properties are used together, Vercel cannot properly apply the SPA rewrite rules needed for client-side routing.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Problem Analysis
- ✅ Verified TanStack Router configuration was correct
- ✅ Confirmed route generation working (`bun run routes:generate`)
- ✅ Checked route tree generation in `routeTree.gen.ts`
- ✅ Verified all route files properly configured with `createFileRoute()`
- ❌ Identified issue was in Vercel deployment configuration

### 2. Fix Implementation
1. **Removed conflicting properties**: `cleanUrls` and `trailingSlash`
2. **Maintained essential rewrites**: Kept SPA rewrite rule
3. **Preserved security**: Maintained all security headers
4. **Deployed fix**: Successfully deployed simplified configuration

### 3. Final Working Configuration
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "neonpro",
  "buildCommand": "cd apps/web && bun install && bun run build",
  "outputDirectory": "apps/web/dist",
  "installCommand": "bun install",
  "framework": null,
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "headers": [...],
  "env": {...},
  "build": {...},
  "regions": ["gru1"]
}
```

## Verification Results
✅ Dashboard route (`/dashboard`) - HTTP 200 OK
✅ Login route (`/login`) - HTTP 200 OK  
✅ Appointments route (`/appointments`) - HTTP 200 OK
✅ Patients route (`/patients`) - HTTP 200 OK
✅ Local development server - Working correctly
✅ Production deployment - Working correctly

## Key Learnings
1. **Vercel SPA Routing**: Avoid mixing `cleanUrls`/`trailingSlash` with `rewrites`
2. **Debugging Approach**: Test deployment configuration separately from application code
3. **TanStack Router**: Works correctly when deployment is properly configured

## Prevention Measures
- Always test all routes after deployment configuration changes
- Validate Vercel configuration for conflicts before deployment
- Document working configurations to prevent regression
