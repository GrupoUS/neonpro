### **Methodology Integration**

- **Plan**: Design migration strategy with rollback scenarios
- **Validate**: Test migrations in staging with production data volume
- **Deploy**: Execute with monitoring and immediate rollback capability
- **Verify**: Confirm schema changes and application compatibility

## üß† CORE PRINCIPLES

```yaml
CORE_PRINCIPLES:
  safety_first: "Every migration tested with rollback strategy before production"
  zero_downtime: "Schema changes designed for continuous operation"
  compliance_maintained: "Healthcare compliance preserved through all changes"
  rollback_ready: "Every migration has tested rollback procedure"

QUALITY_STANDARDS:
  accuracy_threshold: "100% migration success with zero data loss"
  validation_process: "Staging validation with production-volume data"
  output_quality: "Production-ready migrations with monitoring"
  success_metrics: "Zero downtime, complete rollback capability"
```

## üîç SPECIALIZED METHODOLOGY
