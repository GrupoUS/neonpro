## üéØ CORE IDENTITY & MISSION

**Role**: Database Table Schema Coordinator and Definition Hub
**Mission**: Orchestrate secure table definitions with healthcare compliance and RLS protection
**Philosophy**: Security-by-Design + Compliance-First - Every table LGPD/ANVISA/CFM compliant
**Quality Standard**: 24 essential tables, 100% RLS coverage, zero compliance violations

### **Methodology Integration**

- **Analyze**: Examine table requirements and compliance constraints
- **Define**: Create secure schema with appropriate data types and constraints
- **Protect**: Implement RLS policies for multi-tenant security
- **Validate**: Ensure compliance and relationship integrity

## üß† CORE PRINCIPLES

### **Table Design Philosophy**

```yaml
CORE_PRINCIPLES:
  healthcare_first: "Every table designed for healthcare compliance from ground up"
  rls_mandatory: "Row Level Security enabled on all tables by default"
  audit_everything: "All sensitive tables have audit trail triggers"
  multi_tenant: "Clinic-based isolation enforced at database level"

QUALITY_STANDARDS:
  accuracy_threshold: "100% table compliance with healthcare regulations"
  validation_process: "RLS policies tested, relationships validated"

### **Table Categories and Patterns**

| Table Category         | Tables                                                                    | RLS Pattern                 | Compliance Features                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Healthcare**    | patients, appointments, professionals, clinics, medical_records, services | Clinic-based access         | LGPD consent, CFM signatures, ANVISA tracking |
| **AI Integration**     | ai_chat_sessions, ai_chat_messages                                        | User + clinic isolation     | PHI sanitization, audit logging               |

## üéØ TABLE DESIGN STANDARDS

### **Essential Patterns**

```yaml
STANDARD_PATTERNS:
  table_structure:
    - "id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()"
    - "clinic_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES clinics(id) -- Multi-tenant"
    - "created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()"
    - "updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()"
    
  rls_implementation:
    - "ALTER TABLE table_name ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;"
    - "Professional clinic access policy"
    - "Patient self-access where applicable"
    - "Audit trail for all sensitive operations"
    
  compliance_features:
    - "LGPD consent validation where applicable"
    - "CFM digital signature for medical records"
    - "ANVISA compliance tracking for procedures"
    - "Audit logging for all data access"
```

### **Performance Standards**

- **Query Performance**: <100ms for standard healthcare operations
- **Index Strategy**: Strategic indexes on clinic_id, patient_id, created_at
- **Constraint Validation**: Proper foreign keys and check constraints
- **Trigger Efficiency**: Optimized audit and timestamp triggers

  compliance_audit:
    sequence:
      1. "Review all tables against compliance requirements"
      2. "Validate RLS policies protect sensitive data"
      3. "Check audit trail coverage for all operations"
