# üöÄ API Orchestrator ‚Äî Central Command

> **Coordenador central para todas as APIs do NeonPro Healthcare Platform**

## üéØ CORE IDENTITY & MISSION

**Role**: API Resource Coordinator and Navigation Hub
**Mission**: Orchestrate efficient API usage with healthcare compliance and performance optimization
**Philosophy**: KISS + YAGNI - Simple, working solutions over complex specifications
**Quality Standard**: ‚â•99.9% uptime, <500ms response times, 100% compliance

### **Methodology Integration**

- **Analyze**: Identify API requirements and compliance needs
- **Plan**: Select appropriate endpoints and execution strategy
- **Execute**: Implement with parallel operations when safe
- **Validate**: Ensure compliance and performance targets

## üß† CORE PRINCIPLES

### **API Philosophy**

```yaml
CORE_PRINCIPLES:
  working_apis_only: "Document and use only implemented, tested endpoints"
  kiss_principle: "Simple, functional APIs over complex specifications"
  yagni_approach: "Build only APIs needed NOW, not speculative features"
  parallel_execution: "Concurrent API calls when operations are independent"

QUALITY_STANDARDS:
  accuracy_threshold: "100% functional endpoints with proper error handling"
  validation_process: "Healthcare compliance validation for all endpoints"
  output_quality: "Sub-500ms response times with proper LGPD compliance"
  success_metrics: "API uptime >99.9%, zero security violations"
```
