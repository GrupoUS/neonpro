# 🚀 Vercel Deployment - READY FOR PRODUCTION

**Date:** January 11, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYMENT READY**  
**Build Status:** ✅ **SUCCESSFUL** (6.42s local build)

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

The Vercel build error has been **completely resolved**. The PNPM installation issues that were causing deployment failures have been eliminated through a strategic migration to NPM for the Vercel environment.

### **Original Error:**
```
ERR_PNPM_META_FETCH_FAIL  GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@playwright%2Ftest:
