# ðŸ§ª Testing Orchestrator with TDD Agent Coordination â€” Version: 3.0.0

## Overview

Central coordinator for comprehensive testing ecosystem orchestrated by specialized code review agents. Implements systematic TDD cycles with intelligent agent delegation, quality gate enforcement, and healthcare compliance validation.

**Target Audience**: Development teams, QA engineers, DevOps specialists, LLM agents
**Integration Level**: Advanced (multi-agent orchestration)

## ðŸ¤– LLM Orchestration Guide

### Mandatory Execution Sequence

**ALWAYS follow this exact sequence when handling testing tasks:**

1. **Sequential Thinking** â†’ Analyze requirements and complexity
2. **Archon Task Management** â†’ Create/update tasks and check project context
3. **Serena Codebase Analysis** â†’ Understand existing code and patterns
4. **TDD Implementation** â†’ Execute red-green-refactor cycles
5. **Validation & Documentation** â†’ Verify results and update knowledge base

### MCP Integration Rules

```yaml
CRITICAL_MCPS:
  archon: "MANDATORY - All task management and knowledge storage"
  serena: "MANDATORY - All codebase search and semantic analysis"
  desktop-commander: "MANDATORY - All file operations and terminal commands"

NEVER_USE:
  - Native search tools
  - Native codebase analysis tools
  - Direct file manipulation without desktop-commander

TESTING_WORKFLOW:
  1. archon.get_task() â†’ Understand current testing requirements
  2. serena.get_symbols_overview() â†’ Analyze existing test structure
  3. serena.find_symbol() â†’ Locate relevant test files
  4. desktop-commander.write_file() â†’ Implement tests in chunks â‰¤30 lines
  5. archon.update_task() â†’ Track progress and findings
```

## Agent-Orchestrated Testing Framework

### TDD Cycle Coordination

#### RED Phase (Test Definition)
- **Primary Agent**: `test.md` - Pattern enforcement and structure
- **Support Agents**:
  - `architect-review.md` - Design validation and architecture tests
  - `security-auditor.md` - Security test requirements (compliance-driven)

```yaml
red_phase:
  coordinator: test
  workflow:
    1. "Define test structure and patterns"
    2. "Validate architectural test approach" 
    3. "Ensure security test coverage"
    4. "Create failing tests (RED state)"
  quality_gates:
    - "Test patterns compliance â‰¥95%"
    - "Architecture alignment â‰¥90%"
    - "Security coverage â‰¥100%"
```

#### GREEN Phase (Implementation)
- **Primary Agent**: `code-reviewer.md` - Quality analysis
- **Support Agents**:
  - `architect-review.md` - Pattern compliance validation
  - `security-auditor.md` - Vulnerability scanning
  - `test.md` - Test execution validation

```yaml
green_phase:
  coordinator: code-reviewer
  workflow:
    1. "Implement minimal code to pass tests"
    2. "Validate architectural patterns"
    3. "Perform security analysis"
    4. "Verify test success (GREEN state)"
  quality_gates:
    - "All tests passing â‰¥100%"
    - "Code quality metrics â‰¥85%"
    - "Security validation â‰¥100%"
    - "Pattern compliance â‰¥90%"
```

#### REFACTOR Phase (Optimization)
- **Coordination**: Parallel execution across all agents
- **Agents**:
  - `code-reviewer.md` - Code quality improvements
  - `architect-review.md` - Design optimization
  - `security-auditor.md` - Security hardening
  - `test.md` - Test optimization

```yaml
refactor_phase:
  coordination: parallel
  workflow:
    1. "Identify refactoring opportunities"
    2. "Apply design improvements"
    3. "Enhance security measures"
    4. "Optimize test suite"
  quality_gates:
    - "Quality metrics improved â‰¥10%"
    - "Architecture score maintained â‰¥90%"
    - "Security posture improved â‰¥100%"
    - "Test performance improved â‰¥5%"
```

## Testing Hierarchy with Agent Assignment

- **Support**: `security-auditor.md` for compliance
- **Coverage Target**: â‰¥80% for integrations
- **Location**: `tools/tests/integration/`

### E2E Tests (tdd-orchestrator coordination)
- **Focus**: Critical user workflows, end-to-end validation
- **Agent**: All agents parallel validation
- **Special**: Healthcare compliance workflows
- **Coverage Target**: â‰¥70% for critical flows
- **Location**: `tools/tests/e2e/`

### Security Tests (security-auditor coordination)
- **Focus**: LGPD/GDPR/HIPAA compliance, vulnerability scanning
- **Agent**: `security-auditor.md` primary validation
- **Support**: `architect-review.md` for design security
- **Coverage Target**: â‰¥95% for compliance paths
- **Location**: `tools/tests/security/`

## Quick Navigation & Commands

### Agent-Specific Testing

```bash
# Backend â†” database regression (architect-review + code-reviewer)
pnpm test:backend

# Frontend regression & accessibility (test + code-reviewer)
pnpm test:frontend
pnpm test:a11y

# Healthcare compliance suites (security-auditor primary)
pnpm test:healthcare -- --regression
pnpm test:healthcare -- --audit-only
```

### Master Orchestration Commands

```bash
# Full constitutional audit (all agents)
pnpm constitutional:full

# Quick audit smoke
pnpm constitutional:quick

# Performance benchmark snapshot
pnpm constitutional:benchmark
```

Log every run ID and console summary in Archon task notes so audit evidence stays traceable.

### For Any Testing Task

```bash
# 1. ALWAYS start with sequential thinking
sequential-thinking â†’ analyze requirements, complexity, and approach

# 2. MANDATORY Archon integration
archon.list_tasks() â†’ check current testing tasks
archon.get_task(task_id) â†’ understand specific requirements
archon.update_task(status="doing") â†’ mark as in progress

# 3. MANDATORY Serena codebase analysis
serena.get_symbols_overview() â†’ understand project structure
serena.find_symbol() â†’ locate relevant test files and patterns
serena.search_for_pattern() â†’ find existing test implementations

# 4. Select appropriate guide and execute
# Based on triggers above, choose the correct testing guide
# Follow the specific patterns and examples in that guide

# 5. Implementation with desktop-commander
desktop-commander.write_file() â†’ create tests in â‰¤30 line chunks
desktop-commander.start_process("bun test") â†’ run tests
desktop-commander.start_process("bun run lint:fix") â†’ fix issues

# 6. MANDATORY task completion
archon.update_task(status="review") â†’ mark for review
archon.create_document() â†’ document any new patterns or learnings
```

### Healthcare Compliance Priority

**CRITICAL**: For patient data or healthcare features, ALWAYS prioritize:
1. **Security-first testing** â†’ Use `database-security-testing.md`
2. **LGPD compliance validation** â†’ Include data protection tests
3. **Audit trail verification** â†’ Test logging and monitoring
4. **RLS policy enforcement** â†’ Validate access controls

### Common LLM Patterns

```typescript
// âœ… ALWAYS use this pattern for healthcare tests
describe('Patient Data Access - LGPD Compliance', () => {
  beforeEach(async () => {
    // security-auditor: Setup isolated test environment
    await setupTestDatabase();
    await seedTestData();
  });

  it('enforces RLS policies for cross-clinic access', async () => {
    // security-auditor: Validate unauthorized access is blocked
    const unauthorizedAccess = async () => {
      // Test implementation
    };
    await expect(unauthorizedAccess()).rejects.toThrow('Access denied');
  });
});

// âœ… ALWAYS include audit logging tests
it('logs patient data access for compliance', async () => {
  // compliance-checker: Verify audit trail
  const patientData = await getPatientData(patientId, userId);
  const auditLogs = await getAuditLogs({ action: 'patient_data_access' });
  expect(auditLogs).toHaveLength(1);
  expect(auditLogs[0]).toMatchObject({
    userId,
    patientId,
    action: 'patient_data_access'
  });
});
