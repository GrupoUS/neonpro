# ðŸ§ª Testing Orchestrator with TDD Agent Coordination â€” Version: 3.0.0

## Overview

Central coordinator for comprehensive testing ecosystem orchestrated by specialized code review agents. Implements systematic TDD cycles with intelligent agent delegation, quality gate enforcement, and healthcare compliance validation.

**Target Audience**: Development teams, QA engineers, DevOps specialists
**Integration Level**: Advanced (multi-agent orchestration)

## Agent-Orchestrated Testing Framework

### TDD Cycle Coordination

#### RED Phase (Test Definition)
- **Primary Agent**: `test.md` - Pattern enforcement and structure
- **Support Agents**:
  - `architect-review.md` - Design validation and architecture tests
  - `security-auditor.md` - Security test requirements (compliance-driven)

```yaml
red_phase:
  coordinator: test
  workflow:
    1. "Define test structure and patterns"
    2. "Validate architectural test approach" 
    3. "Ensure security test coverage"
    4. "Create failing tests (RED state)"
  quality_gates:
    - "Test patterns compliance â‰¥95%"
    - "Architecture alignment â‰¥90%"
    - "Security coverage â‰¥100%"
```

#### GREEN Phase (Implementation)
- **Primary Agent**: `code-reviewer.md` - Quality analysis
- **Support Agents**:
  - `architect-review.md` - Pattern compliance validation
  - `security-auditor.md` - Vulnerability scanning
  - `test.md` - Test execution validation

```yaml
green_phase:
  coordinator: code-reviewer
  workflow:
    1. "Implement minimal code to pass tests"
    2. "Validate architectural patterns"
    3. "Perform security analysis"
    4. "Verify test success (GREEN state)"
  quality_gates:
    - "All tests passing â‰¥100%"
    - "Code quality metrics â‰¥85%"
    - "Security validation â‰¥100%"
    - "Pattern compliance â‰¥90%"
```

#### REFACTOR Phase (Optimization)
- **Coordination**: Parallel execution across all agents
- **Agents**:
  - `code-reviewer.md` - Code quality improvements
  - `architect-review.md` - Design optimization
  - `security-auditor.md` - Security hardening
  - `test.md` - Test optimization

```yaml
refactor_phase:
  coordination: parallel
  workflow:
    1. "Identify refactoring opportunities"
    2. "Apply design improvements"
    3. "Enhance security measures"
    4. "Optimize test suite"
  quality_gates:
    - "Quality metrics improved â‰¥10%"
    - "Architecture score maintained â‰¥90%"
    - "Security posture improved â‰¥100%"
    - "Test performance improved â‰¥5%"
```

## Testing Hierarchy with Agent Assignment

- **Focus**: Functions, components, business logic
- **Agent**: `code-reviewer.md` validates quality metrics
- **Coverage Target**: â‰¥90% for critical paths
- **Location**: `tools/tests/unit/`

### Integration Tests (architect-review coordination)

- **Agent**: `architect-review.md` validates patterns
- **Support**: `security-auditor.md` for compliance
- **Coverage Target**: â‰¥80% for integrations
- **Location**: `tools/tests/integration/`

### E2E Tests (tdd-orchestrator coordination)
- **Focus**: Critical user workflows, end-to-end validation
- **Agent**: All agents parallel validation
- **Special**: Healthcare compliance workflows
- **Coverage Target**: â‰¥70% for critical flows
- **Location**: `tools/tests/e2e/`

### Security Tests (security-auditor coordination)
- **Focus**: LGPD/GDPR/HIPAA compliance, vulnerability scanning
- **Agent**: `security-auditor.md` primary validation
- **Support**: `architect-review.md` for design security
- **Coverage Target**: â‰¥95% for compliance paths
- **Location**: `tools/tests/security/`
