## Introduction

This guide provides a comprehensive approach to integration testing for healthcare applications with specific focus on Brazil's General Data Protection Law (LGPD) compliance requirements. Healthcare applications handle sensitive personal data and require rigorous testing to ensure both functionality and data protection.

## LGPD Compliance Requirements

1. **Lawful, Fair, and Transparent Processing**
   - Ensure all test data processing has a valid legal basis
   - Document all data processing activities during testing
   - Implement transparency mechanisms in test environments

2. **Purpose Limitation**
   - Use test data only for explicitly defined testing purposes
   - Avoid repurposing test data for other activities
   - Implement data retention policies for test data

3. **Data Minimization**
   - Use only the minimum necessary data for testing
   - Implement data masking techniques for sensitive fields
   - Create synthetic test data when possible

4. **Accuracy**
   - Ensure test data is accurate and up-to-date
   - Implement mechanisms to correct inaccurate test data
   - Validate data accuracy during test execution

5. **Storage Limitation**
   - Implement automatic deletion of test data after retention periods

2. **Data Anonymization Techniques**
   - Implement irreversible anonymization for sensitive fields
   - Use techniques like k-anonymity and l-diversity
   - Validate that anonymized data cannot be re-identified

3. **Data Masking**
   - Implement reversible masking for testing scenarios
   - Use format-preserving masking for structured data
   - Ensure masked data maintains realistic characteristics

### Test Data Storage

1. **Secure Storage Practices**
   - Implement encryption for test data at rest
   - Use secure key management practices
   - Document encryption methodologies

2. **Access Controls**
   - Implement role-based access to test data
   - Use principle of least privilege
