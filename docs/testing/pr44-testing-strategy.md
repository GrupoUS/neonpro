# PR 44 Comprehensive Testing Strategy

## Overview

PR 44 introduces AI-assisted 3-step CRUD API with intent→confirm→execute flow, Chart UI components with recharts integration, Card UI updates, and mobile breakpoint detection. This testing strategy ensures healthcare compliance, accessibility, and performance requirements are met.

## Testing Infrastructure Analysis

### Current Testing Stack
- **Vitest** - Unit and integration testing with React Testing Library
- **Playwright** - End-to-end testing and accessibility validation
- **MSW** - API mocking for isolated component testing
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and compile-time validation
- **Healthcare-specific** - LGPD/CFM/ANVISA compliance frameworks

### Test Configuration
- **Test Environment**: jsdom for unit tests, Playwright for E2E
- **Coverage Target**: ≥90% for critical components
- **Timeout**: 30s standard, 60s for integration tests
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with parallel execution

## Testing Methodology: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR

### Phase 1: RED (Write Failing Tests)
1. Define test cases for all new features
2. Create failing tests that specify expected behavior
3. Ensure comprehensive coverage of edge cases
4. Validate healthcare compliance requirements

### Phase 2: GREEN (Minimal Implementation)
1. Implement minimal code to pass tests
2. Focus on functionality over optimization
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Validate compliance and security requirements

### Phase 3: REFACTOR (Optimize)
1. Improve code quality and performance
2. Enhance maintainability and readability
3. Ensure tests remain green
4. Apply healthcare best practices
