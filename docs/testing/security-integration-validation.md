## 🔍 Integration Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Patient Registration with CPF Validation
```typescript
// Test patient registration with Brazilian CPF
POST /api/v1/patients
Headers:
  Content-Type: application/json
  X-LGPD-Consent: patient-data-processing-consent
Body:
{
  "cpf": "123.456.789-09",
  "fullName": "João Silva Santos",
  "dateOfBirth": "1990-01-15",
  "email": "joao@example.com"
}

Expected: ✅ Validation passes, patient created with audit log
```

### Scenario 2: Emergency Access with Professional License
```typescript
// Test emergency medical records access
GET /api/emergency/v1/patients/123/medical-records
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer <healthcare_provider_jwt>
  X-Emergency-Access: {
    "type": "medical",
    "justification": "Patient in critical condition requiring immediate access",
    "patientId": "123"
  }

Expected: ✅ Emergency access granted with enhanced audit logging
```

### Scenario 3: Rate Limiting with Emergency Bypass
```typescript
// Test rate limiting and emergency bypass
// 1. Make 100+ requests to trigger rate limit
// 2. Add emergency header to bypass

Expected: ✅ Standard requests rate limited, emergency requests bypass limits
```

### Scenario 4: Healthcare Provider Registration
```typescript
// Test healthcare provider with professional license
POST /api/v1/professionals
Headers:
  Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
  "cpf": "987.654.321-00",
  "fullName": "Dr. Maria Santos",
  "licenses": [{
    "number": "123456",
    "type": "crm",
    "state": "SP"
  }]
}

Expected: ✅ License validation passes, provider registered
```

### Scenario 5: CORS Policy Validation
```typescript
// Test healthcare CORS policies
OPTIONS /api/v1/patients
Headers:
  Origin: https://portal.neonpro.health
  Access-Control-Request-Method: POST

Expected: ✅ CORS headers include healthcare-specific configurations
```

## 🚨 Security Headers Validation

### Expected Headers in Production:
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; ...
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
X-LGPD-Compliant: true
X-Healthcare-Compliance: ANVISA,CFM,LGPD
X-Security-Level: production
```

### Expected in Emergency Access:
```
X-Emergency-Access-Granted: true
X-Emergency-Audit-Required: true
X-Emergency-Justification-Required: true
```
