# 🚀 VS Code Configuration Management Guide

## 📋 Overview

This guide covers the VS Code configuration management for the NeonPro Healthcare platform. **As of August 2025, all VS Code configurations have been consolidated into the user profile for centralized management and optimal developer experience.**

## 🎯 Configuration Architecture

### **Centralized Configuration Approach** ✅

All VS Code configurations are now managed through the **user profile** rather than workspace-specific settings:

**Location**: `C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\`

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Single Source of Truth**: One configuration location for all projects
- ✅ **Clean Project Directory**: No `.vscode` folder cluttering the repository
- ✅ **Team Flexibility**: Each developer can maintain their own configuration preferences
- ✅ **Zero Conflicts**: No configuration merge conflicts in version control
- ✅ **Global Availability**: All settings, tasks, and snippets available across all projects

## 📁 Configuration Files Structure

```
C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\
├── settings.json              # Global VS Code settings with healthcare compliance
├── tasks.json                 # All development tasks (529 lines)
├── launch.json                # All debugging configurations (330 lines)
├── keybindings.json          # Custom keyboard shortcuts
└── snippets\
    ├── neonpro.code-snippets                    # Core NeonPro snippets
    ├── neonpro-ultracite.code-snippets         # Ultracite/Biome patterns
    ├── neonpro-healthcare.code-snippets        # LGPD/ANVISA/CFM compliance
    ├── neonpro-global.code-snippets            # Global project snippets
    └── neonpro-healthcare-global.code-snippets # Global healthcare snippets
```

## 🏗️ Migration History

## 🔧 Team Developer Setup

### **New Developer Onboarding**

**For new team members**, the configuration setup is automatic:

1. **Install VS Code**: Download and install VS Code
2. **Clone Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/GrupoUS/neonpro.git`
3. **Install Dependencies**: `pnpm install`
4. **Ready to Go**: All tasks, debugging, and snippets are immediately available

**No additional configuration needed!** All settings are global and will work across any NeonPro project.

### **Configuration Customization**

If a developer wants to customize their configuration:

1. **Personal Settings**: Modify `C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json`
2. **Additional Tasks**: Add to `C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\tasks.json`
3. **Custom Snippets**: Create new files in `C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\snippets\`

## 🔄 Rollback Information

### **If Rollback is Needed**

Backup files are available at:
- **Workspace Backup**: `D:\neonpro\BACKUP-vscode-config-20250822-*`
- **User Profile Backup**: `C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\BACKUP-user-config-20250822-*`

**Rollback Steps**:
1. Stop VS Code
2. Restore backup files to original locations
3. Recreate `.vscode` directory if needed
4. Restart VS Code

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Tasks not appearing**:
- Restart VS Code to refresh task detection
- Check if you're in a workspace folder
- Verify pnpm is installed and accessible

**2. Snippets not working**:
- Check file extension matches snippet scope
- Restart VS Code if snippets don't appear
- Verify snippet files are in correct location

**3. Debug configurations missing**:
- Check if launch.json exists in user profile
- Restart VS Code to refresh debug configurations
- Verify Node.js and development dependencies are installed

### Performance Issues

**1. Global configurations loading slowly**:
- VS Code may take longer to load with extensive global configurations
- Consider removing unused snippets if performance is affected
- Global configurations are loaded once and cached
