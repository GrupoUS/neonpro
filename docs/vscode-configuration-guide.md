```

### 4. `.vscode/neonpro-healthcare.code-snippets` (713 lines) **NEW**

**Purpose**: Healthcare compliance templates and components.

**Available Snippets**:

| Prefix | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `lgpd` | LGPD-compliant component with audit logging |
| `anvisa` | ANVISA medical form with regulatory validation |
| `cfm` | CFM medical ethics compliance component |
| `health-biome` | Healthcare-specific Biome configuration |
| `audit-hook` | Comprehensive healthcare audit logging hook |

## 🏥 Healthcare Compliance Features

### LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados) Compliance
- Automatic data access logging
- Purpose limitation implementation
- Legal basis validation
- Data subject rights support

### ANVISA (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária) Compliance
- RDC 44/2009 medical record validation
- Regulatory procedure code validation
- Medical professional CRM validation
- Audit trail for medical records

### CFM (Conselho Federal de Medicina) Compliance
- Medical ethics validation (Resolution 1.974/2011)
- Patient consent validation (Resolution 2.314/2022)
- Professional conduct logging
- Ethics violation reporting

## 🛠️ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Using Tasks

**Format all code**:
```bash
Ctrl+Shift+P → "Tasks: Run Task" → "🎯 VIBECODE: Format Code"
```

**Run compliance checks**:
```bash
Ctrl+Shift+P → "Tasks: Run Task" → "🏥 COMPLIANCE: LGPD Check"
```

**Generate quality report**:
```bash
Ctrl+Shift+P → "Tasks: Run Task" → "📊 REPORT: Generate Quality Report"
```

### 2. Using Snippets

**Create LGPD-compliant component**:
1. Create new `.tsx` file
2. Type `lgpd` and press Tab
3. Fill in component details
4. Auto-generated with audit logging

**Create healthcare form**:
1. Type `anvisa` and press Tab
2. Generates ANVISA-compliant medical form
3. Includes regulatory validation

### 3. Debugging Healthcare Applications

**Debug with compliance context**:
1. Select "Debug Next.js Healthcare" configuration
2. Set breakpoints in healthcare components
3. Debug with compliance validation enabled

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Code Quality
- Always run format task before committing
- Use Ultracite snippets for consistency
- Follow strict TypeScript patterns

### 2. Healthcare Compliance
- Use healthcare snippets for medical components
- Always implement audit logging
- Validate regulatory requirements

### 3. Performance
- Use performance profiling configurations
- Monitor memory usage with diagnostic tasks
- Follow Ultracite optimization patterns

## 🧪 Testing Integration

### Unit Testing
```bash
# Run with coverage
Ctrl+Shift+P → "Tasks: Run Task" → "📊 VITEST: Coverage Report"

# Debug tests
F5 → "Debug Vitest Tests"
```

### E2E Testing
```bash
# Run E2E tests
Ctrl+Shift+P → "Tasks: Run Task" → "🎭 PLAYWRIGHT: Run E2E Tests"

# Debug E2E
F5 → "Debug Playwright E2E"
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Task not found**:
- Ensure you're in the correct workspace folder
- Check if pnpm is installed
- Verify tasks.json syntax

**2. Debug configuration not working**:
- Check if Next.js dev server is running
- Verify environment variables are set
- Ensure source maps are enabled

**3. Snippets not appearing**:
- Check file extension (.tsx, .ts, .json)
- Verify snippet scope matches file type
- Restart VS Code if needed

### Performance Issues

**1. Biome running slow**:
- Use chunked file operations
- Check memory usage with diagnostic task
- Consider excluding large files

**2. Debug session slow**:
- Use appropriate debug configuration
- Check if multiple sessions are running
- Verify source map generation
