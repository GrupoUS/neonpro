npx vercel logs --follow

# NEW UNIFIED COMMANDS
./scripts/deploy-unified.sh monitor logs
./scripts/deploy-unified.sh monitor health
./scripts/deploy-unified.sh monitor metrics
```

## üè• Healthcare Compliance Migration

The unified script maintains all healthcare compliance features from `deploy.sh`:

### LGPD Compliance Checks
```bash
# OLD: Built into deploy.sh
./scripts/deploy.sh production

# NEW: Available as separate test or during deployment
./scripts/deploy-unified.sh test compliance
./scripts/deploy-unified.sh deploy  # Includes compliance checks
```

### Audit Logging Validation
```bash
# OLD: Part of deploy.sh healthcare checks
# NEW: Integrated into compliance testing
./scripts/deploy-unified.sh test compliance
```

## üöÄ Enhanced Features

The unified script provides several enhancements over the existing scripts:

### 1. Intelligent Build Strategy Selection
```bash
# Automatically selects best available strategy
./scripts/deploy-unified.sh deploy

# Explicit strategy selection
./scripts/deploy-unified.sh deploy --strategy turbo
./scripts/deploy-unified.sh deploy --strategy bun
./scripts/deploy-unified.sh deploy --strategy npm
```

### 2. Comprehensive Error Handling
- Advanced error detection and reporting
- Automatic retry mechanisms
- Detailed error logging
- Recovery suggestions

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Build time tracking
- Deployment duration monitoring
- Performance benchmarking
- Success rate reporting

### 4. Modular Testing
```bash
# Basic tests (type checking, linting)
./scripts/deploy-unified.sh test basic

# Full test suite (includes unit tests)
./scripts/deploy-unified.sh test full

# Healthcare compliance validation
./scripts/deploy-unified.sh test compliance
```

## üîß Migration Steps

### Step 1: Test the Unified Script
```bash
# Test build functionality
./scripts/deploy-unified.sh build --strategy turbo

# Test validation
./scripts/deploy-unified.sh validate

# Test configuration
./scripts/deploy-unified.sh config
```

### Step 2: Update CI/CD Pipelines
Replace old script calls in your CI/CD configurations:

```yaml
# OLD GitHub Actions step
- name: Deploy to Vercel
  run: ./scripts/deploy-neonpro-turborepo.sh --production

# NEW GitHub Actions step
- name: Deploy to Vercel
  run: ./scripts/deploy-unified.sh deploy --production --strategy turbo
```

### Step 3: Update Documentation
Update any documentation that references the old scripts:

- README.md deployment instructions
- Developer onboarding guides
- Deployment runbooks
- Troubleshooting guides

### Step 4: Team Training
Ensure team members are familiar with the new commands:

```bash
# Show help
./scripts/deploy-unified.sh help

# Common workflows
./scripts/deploy-unified.sh deploy --preview
./scripts/deploy-unified.sh validate --comprehensive
./scripts/deploy-unified.sh monitor health
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Script Cleanup

After successful migration, consider archiving old scripts:

### Scripts to Archive
```bash
# Create archive directory
mkdir -p scripts/archive/

# Move old scripts
mv scripts/deploy.sh scripts/archive/
mv scripts/deploy-neonpro.sh scripts/archive/
mv scripts/deploy-neonpro-turborepo.sh scripts/archive/
mv scripts/vercel-build.sh scripts/archive/
mv scripts/vercel-build-optimized.sh scripts/archive/
mv scripts/validate-deployment.sh scripts/archive/
mv scripts/smoke-test.sh scripts/archive/
mv scripts/simple-smoke-test.sh scripts/archive/

# Keep these scripts (still needed)
# - deploy-api-separate.sh (API deployment)
# - verify-deployment-config.js (Node.js config verification)
```

### Update .gitignore
```bash
# Add to .gitignore if archiving
scripts/archive/
```

## üö® Rollback Plan

If issues arise with the unified script:

### Immediate Rollback
```bash
# Restore from archive
cp scripts/archive/deploy-neonpro-turborepo.sh scripts/

# Use original script
./scripts/deploy-neonpro-turborepo.sh --production
```

### Gradual Migration
```bash
# Use both scripts during transition
./scripts/deploy-unified.sh deploy --preview  # Test with preview
./scripts/deploy-neonpro-turborepo.sh --production  # Keep production stable
```
