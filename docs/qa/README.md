# QA Assessment and Gates Documentation Structure

This directory contains all quality assurance documentation for NeonPro's brownfield development
following the BMAD methodology.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

### `/assessments/` - Individual Assessment Reports

- **Risk Assessment Reports**: `{epic}.{story}-risk-{YYYYMMDD}.md`
- **Test Design Reports**: `{epic}.{story}-test-design-{YYYYMMDD}.md`
- **Requirements Traceability**: `{epic}.{story}-trace-{YYYYMMDD}.md`
- **NFR Validation Reports**: `{epic}.{story}-nfr-{YYYYMMDD}.md`

### `/gates/` - Quality Gate Decisions

- **Gate Decision Files**: `{epic}.{story}-{slug}.yml`
- **Historical Gate Records**: Immutable audit trail of all quality decisions

## üè• Healthcare-Specific QA Standards

### Mandatory Validations

- **Patient Data Integrity**: All AI features must preserve existing healthcare data
- **LGPD Compliance**: Privacy protection for AI processing of patient information
- **ANVISA Standards**: Medical device compliance for AI assistance features
- **CFM Ethics**: Professional medical practice guidelines for AI integration

### Performance Requirements

- **Dashboard Load Time**: <2s maintained for healthcare professional workflows
- **AI Response Time**: <500ms for chat, <200ms for predictions
- **Real-time Updates**: <100ms latency for critical healthcare notifications
- **Mobile Access**: <3s for mobile healthcare professional workflows

## üéØ BMAD Brownfield QA Workflow

### Stage 1: Pre-Development Risk Assessment

```bash
@qa *risk "{epic}.{story-name}"    # Risk analysis with healthcare context
@qa *design "{epic}.{story-name}"  # Test strategy for brownfield integration
```

### Stage 2: Development Validation

```bash
@qa *trace "{epic}.{story-name}"   # Requirements coverage verification
@qa *nfr "{epic}.{story-name}"     # Non-functional requirements validation
```

### Stage 3: Comprehensive Review

```bash
@qa *review "{completed-story}"    # Deep integration analysis
@qa *gate "{reviewed-story}"       # Final quality gate decision
```

## üìä Quality Gate Decision Matrix

### PASS (Risk Score ‚â§3)

- All healthcare workflows tested and passing
- Performance baseline maintained (<2s dashboard load)
- Compliance requirements validated (LGPD/ANVISA/CFM)
- Rollback procedures tested and documented

### CONCERNS (Risk Score 4-6)

- Minor performance impact documented and acceptable
- Some test coverage gaps in non-critical areas
- Technical debt introduced but managed
- Requires team review but can proceed with monitoring

### FAIL (Risk Score 7-9)

- Healthcare workflow regression detected
- Critical performance degradation below requirements
- Compliance violation introduced
- Missing essential rollback capabilities

### WAIVED (Any Score with Explicit Approval)

- Issues acknowledged and explicitly accepted by stakeholders
- Business justification documented with senior approval
- Monitoring and mitigation plans established
- Temporary technical debt with clear remediation timeline

## üö® Critical Healthcare Safeguards

### Before Any AI Implementation

1. **Baseline Documentation**: Current healthcare system performance metrics
2. **Rollback Preparation**: Emergency procedures to restore existing functionality
3. **Data Protection**: Patient data safety validation during AI integration
4. **Compliance Verification**: Regulatory requirements confirmation

### During AI Development

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time healthcare system health validation
2. **Incremental Testing**: Each AI component integration tested individually
3. **Performance Tracking**: Healthcare workflow speed and reliability monitoring
4. **Compliance Checking**: Ongoing LGPD/ANVISA/CFM requirement validation

### Post-Implementation Validation

1. **Healthcare Workflow Verification**: Complete end-to-end testing
2. **Performance Confirmation**: Baseline requirements still met
3. **Compliance Certification**: Final regulatory validation
4. **Rollback Testing**: Emergency procedures verified functional

## üìã Usage Guidelines

### Assessment Creation

1. Use appropriate template from `.github/commands/BMad/agents/qa/templates/`
2. Fill in healthcare-specific context and risk factors
3. Apply healthcare criticality multipliers for accurate risk scoring
4. Document all LGPD/ANVISA/CFM compliance considerations

### Gate Decision Process

1. Complete all required assessments for the story complexity level
2. Document comprehensive review findings with healthcare focus
3. Apply healthcare-specific quality gate criteria
4. Ensure rollback procedures are tested and documented

### Documentation Standards

- **Accuracy**: All healthcare business rules correctly understood
- **Compliance**: LGPD/ANVISA/CFM requirements precisely interpreted
- **Risk Calibration**: Scoring reflects true healthcare operational criticality
- **Actionability**: Clear next steps for issue resolution provided

## üîÑ Quality Gate Evolution

### Continuous Improvement

- Track which assessments prevent the most healthcare workflow issues
- Incorporate medical professional feedback into quality criteria
- Update templates with regulatory requirement changes
- Refine scoring based on actual healthcare impact data

### Template Management

- Version control all templates with detailed changelog
- Maintain backward compatibility for historical assessments
- Provide clear migration guidance for template improvements
- Archive historical formats for audit compliance

**Key Principle**: This QA documentation structure ensures NeonPro's AI transformation never
compromises existing healthcare functionality while enabling revolutionary improvements in patient
care and medical practice efficiency.
