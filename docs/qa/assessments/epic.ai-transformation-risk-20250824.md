## üéØ Risk Scoring Matrix

### Probability Assessment (1-9)

**Score**: `7`

**Justification**:

```
9: Change touches critical healthcare code paths with complex dependencies
6: Change affects shared healthcare utilities or common workflows
3: Change affects isolated features with some healthcare integration
1: Change is completely isolated from existing healthcare functionality
```

**Selected Reasoning**:
`This is a major AI transformation touching multiple critical healthcare systems - patient data, appointments, real-time features, and compliance. Multiple integration points with complex dependencies across the entire healthcare platform architecture.`

### Impact Assessment (1-9)

**Score**: `6`

**Healthcare Workflow Consequences**:

```
9: System failure, patient data loss, compliance violation, medical workflow disruption
6: Healthcare feature broken, significant performance degradation affecting patient care
3: Minor healthcare functionality affected, recoverable issues, some workflow disruption
1: Cosmetic issues, non-critical performance impact, no healthcare workflow effect
```

**Selected Reasoning**:
`Potential for significant healthcare feature impact if AI systems fail or perform poorly. Performance degradation could affect patient care workflows. However, brownfield approach with rollback mechanisms and human fallbacks limits catastrophic failure risk.`

### Healthcare Criticality Multiplier (1.0-3.0)

**Multiplier**: `2.8`

**Category Selection**:

```
Patient_Data_Systems (3.0): Patient registration, records, medical history
Appointment_Management (2.5): Scheduling, calendar, availability systems
Compliance_Reporting (2.5): LGPD/ANVISA/CFM regulatory features
Real_Time_Features (2.0): Live dashboards, notifications, critical updates
AI_Integration_Points (2.0): New AI features touching existing healthcare systems
UI_UX_Healthcare (1.5): Healthcare professional interface modifications
Documentation_Only (1.0): Non-functional documentation updates
```

**Selected Reasoning**:
`This epic spans Patient Data Systems (AI conversation storage), Appointment Management (no-show predictions), and Compliance Reporting (AI consent management). Using weighted average: (3.0 + 2.5 + 2.5) / 3 = 2.67, rounded to 2.8 for conservative assessment.`

### Final Risk Score

**Calculation**: `7 √ó 6 √ó 2.8 = 117.6`

**Risk Level**:

```
PASS (‚â§3): Low risk, standard review process
CONCERNS (4-6): Medium risk, enhanced monitoring required
FAIL (7-9): High risk, comprehensive mitigation mandatory
```

**Epic Risk Level**: `FAIL (7-9) - COMPREHENSIVE MITIGATION MANDATORY`

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Strategies

### Rollback Procedure

**Complexity**: `Complex`

**Step-by-Step Emergency Plan**:

1. `Disable AI features via feature flags (immediate - 30 seconds)`
2. `Revert to standard patient workflows without AI assistance (1-2 minutes)`
3. `Clear AI-specific caches and reset to baseline performance (2-5 minutes)`
4. `Verify core healthcare workflows: appointments, patient access, compliance reporting (5-10 minutes)`
5. `Communicate with healthcare staff about temporary AI service disruption and backup procedures (immediate)`

**Rollback Time Estimate**: `10-15 minutes to complete full rollback to pre-AI state`

### Monitoring Requirements

**Real-time Health Checks**:

- `AI chat response quality and accuracy (>85% confidence threshold)`
- `Dashboard performance maintenance (<2s load time with AI features)`

### Decision Recommendation

**Proceed With**: `COMPREHENSIVE` **monitoring**

**Rationale**:
`The strategic importance and business value ($820,750+ annual returns) justify the high-risk approach, but comprehensive mitigation is mandatory. The brownfield methodology with feature flags and human fallbacks provides sufficient safety mechanisms if properly implemented and monitored.`

**Required Approvals**:
`Healthcare Director, Compliance Officer, Technical Lead, and Product Owner approval required before development commencement`
