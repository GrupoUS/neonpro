     in areas with poor connectivity
   - **Mitigation Plan**: Implement mobile-specific AI performance testing and offline functionality
     validation

### Medium Priority Gaps

**Should Address Before Release**:

1. `Multi-Provider Appointment Coordination and Specialist Referral Optimization`: AI coordination
   between multiple healthcare providers for complex care needs
   - **Impact**: Limited efficiency in managing complex medical cases requiring multiple specialists
   - **Mitigation**: Develop comprehensive multi-provider AI workflow testing and specialist
     coordination validation

2. `Legacy EHR Format Compatibility and Cross-Healthcare System Integration`: AI integration with
   diverse electronic health record systems and data formats
   - **Impact**: Potential data integration issues with existing healthcare infrastructure from
     different providers
   - **Mitigation**: Implement extensive legacy system compatibility testing and data format
     standardization validation

### Low Priority Gaps

**Nice to Have Coverage**:

1. `Multi-Language Health Education and Cultural Health Practice Integration`: AI health education
   content in multiple languages with cultural health consideration
