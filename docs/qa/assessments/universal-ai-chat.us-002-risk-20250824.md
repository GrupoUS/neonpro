## üéØ Risk Scoring Matrix

### Probability Assessment (1-9)
**Score**: `8`

**Justification**:
```
9: Change touches critical healthcare code paths with complex dependencies
6: Change affects shared healthcare utilities or common workflows  
3: Change affects isolated features with some healthcare integration
1: Change is completely isolated from existing healthcare functionality
```

**Selected Reasoning**: `Very high probability of issues - AI-generated SQL queries accessing all patient data through existing RLS policies creates complex security and accuracy dependencies. SQL injection risks and data access control complexity.`

### Impact Assessment (1-9)
**Score**: `8`

**Healthcare Workflow Consequences**:
```
9: System failure, patient data loss, compliance violation, medical workflow disruption
6: Healthcare feature broken, significant performance degradation affecting patient care
3: Minor healthcare functionality affected, recoverable issues, some workflow disruption
1: Cosmetic issues, non-critical performance impact, no healthcare workflow effect
```

**Selected Reasoning**: `High impact potential - Incorrect SQL generation could expose patient data inappropriately, performance degradation could slow critical healthcare workflows, SQL injection could compromise entire database security.`

### Healthcare Criticality Multiplier (1.0-3.0)
**Multiplier**: `3.0`

**Category Selection**:
```
Patient_Data_Systems (3.0): Patient registration, records, medical history
Appointment_Management (2.5): Scheduling, calendar, availability systems  
Compliance_Reporting (2.5): LGPD/ANVISA/CFM regulatory features
Real_Time_Features (2.0): Live dashboards, notifications, critical updates
AI_Integration_Points (2.0): New AI features touching existing healthcare systems
UI_UX_Healthcare (1.5): Healthcare professional interface modifications
Documentation_Only (1.0): Non-functional documentation updates
```

**Selected Reasoning**: `Direct access to Patient Data Systems through AI-generated SQL queries. The AI has potential access to all patient records, medical history, and sensitive healthcare data that staff can access.`

### Final Risk Score
**Calculation**: `8 √ó 8 √ó 3.0 = 192`

**Risk Level**:
```
PASS (‚â§3): Low risk, standard review process
CONCERNS (4-6): Medium risk, enhanced monitoring required
FAIL (7-9): High risk, comprehensive mitigation mandatory
```

**Story Risk Level**: `FAIL (7-9) - CRITICAL RISK - COMPREHENSIVE MITIGATION MANDATORY`

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Strategies

### Rollback Procedure
**Complexity**: `Medium`

**Step-by-Step Emergency Plan**:
1. `Disable natural language query feature via feature flag (immediate - 10 seconds)`
2. `Revoke AI query execution permissions immediately (30 seconds)`
3. `Clear all AI query caches and reset to manual query mode (1 minute)`
4. `Verify existing dashboard queries and database access functionality (2-3 minutes)`
5. `Audit recent AI-generated queries for security or privacy breaches (5-10 minutes)`
6. `Notify all healthcare staff about temporary query assistant unavailability (immediate)`

**Rollback Time Estimate**: `5-15 minutes including security audit`

### Monitoring Requirements
**Real-time Health Checks**:
- `SQL injection detection and prevention validation`
- `RLS policy compliance for all AI-generated queries`
- `Query performance monitoring (maintain <500ms standards)`
- `Data access audit trail completeness and accuracy`
- `Staff permission validation for every AI query execution`

**Alert Thresholds**:
- `Any SQL injection attempt or malformed query generation`
- `RLS policy bypass or unauthorized data access attempts`
- `Query execution time exceeding 500ms baseline`

## üìä Risk Assessment Summary

### Key Risk Factors
1. `SQL injection vulnerability through AI-generated queries potentially compromising entire patient database`
2. `Unauthorized patient data access if RLS policies are bypassed or incorrectly interpreted by AI`
3. `LGPD compliance violations through inappropriate data access patterns generated by AI`

### Recommended Actions
**Before Development**:
- `Implement comprehensive SQL injection prevention and query validation framework`
- `Create rigorous RLS policy testing suite with all staff role scenarios`
- `Establish secure AI query generation environment with isolated database testing`

**During Development**:
- `Daily security testing with penetration testing for SQL injection vulnerabilities`
- `Continuous RLS policy compliance validation with automated testing`
- `Real-time monitoring of all AI-generated queries with security analysis`

**Post-Implementation**:
- `24/7 security monitoring for the first 30 days with immediate response team`
- `Daily security audit of AI-generated queries and data access patterns`
- `Weekly comprehensive security and compliance review with external audit`

### Decision Recommendation
**Proceed With**: `COMPREHENSIVE` **monitoring and security validation**

**Rationale**: `Extremely high risk due to direct AI access to patient database requires maximum security oversight. Business value (60% staff efficiency improvement) justifies risk only with comprehensive security framework. Consider phased rollout with limited staff group initially.`

**Required Approvals**: `Security Officer, LGPD Compliance Officer, Healthcare Director, Database Administrator, and IT Security Lead approval mandatory`
