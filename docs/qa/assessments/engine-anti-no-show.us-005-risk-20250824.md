- `Monthly patient satisfaction assessment and communication quality evaluation`
- `Quarterly review of intervention approaches and success patterns for continuous improvement`

### Decision Recommendation
**Proceed With**: `COMPREHENSIVE` **monitoring and gradual automation rollout**

**Rationale**: `High-risk implementation justified by significant revenue protection potential (78%+ intervention success rate targeting $468,750+ annual protection). Comprehensive monitoring essential due to patient relationship impact. Gradual rollout recommended starting with low-risk interventions and high-confidence patient segments.`

**Required Approvals**: `Practice Manager, Patient Communication Director, LGPD Compliance Officer, Medical Ethics Committee, and IT Security Director approval required`

**Gradual Rollout Strategy**:
- `Phase 1 (Week 1): High-confidence predictions only, SMS reminders for established patients`
- `Phase 2 (Week 2-3): Expand to moderate-risk interventions with manual oversight`
- `Phase 3 (Week 4-5): Full automation for validated intervention types with comprehensive monitoring`
- `Phase 4 (Week 6+): Advanced strategy optimization based on collected effectiveness data`

**Healthcare Safety Note**: All automated interventions must maintain professional healthcare communication standards, respect patient autonomy, and include immediate human oversight mechanisms. Patient relationships must be protected through careful intervention design and monitoring.
