  `Low impact - Risk scoring is operational analytics, not medical device functionality`
- **CFM (Professional Ethics)**:
  `Low impact - Administrative analytics supporting healthcare delivery optimization`
- **Audit Trail**:
  `Enhanced requirements - All ML predictions and risk calculations must be logged for transparency`

### Performance Impact Prediction

## üéØ Risk Scoring Matrix

### Probability Assessment (1-9)

**Score**: `6`

**Justification**:

```
9: Change touches critical healthcare code paths with complex dependencies
6: Change affects shared healthcare utilities or common workflows
3: Change affects isolated features with some healthcare integration
1: Change is completely isolated from existing healthcare functionality
```

**Selected Reasoning**:
`Moderate-high probability - Integration with appointment calendar and patient data systems creates dependencies. ML model accuracy and real-time performance requirements introduce complexity, but no direct modification of core scheduling logic.`

### Impact Assessment (1-9)

**Score**: `4`

**Healthcare Workflow Consequences**:

```
9: System failure, patient data loss, compliance violation, medical workflow disruption
6: Healthcare feature broken, significant performance degradation affecting patient care
3: Minor healthcare functionality affected, recoverable issues, some workflow disruption
1: Cosmetic issues, non-critical performance impact, no healthcare workflow effect
```

**Selected Reasoning**:
`Moderate impact - Incorrect risk scores could lead to poor scheduling decisions or staff confusion. Dashboard performance could be affected, but core appointment functionality remains intact. Risk indicators enhance rather than replace existing workflows.`

### Healthcare Criticality Multiplier (1.0-3.0)

**Multiplier**: `2.0`

**Category Selection**:

```
Patient_Data_Systems (3.0): Patient registration, records, medical history
Appointment_Management (2.5): Scheduling, calendar, availability systems
Compliance_Reporting (2.5): LGPD/ANVISA/CFM regulatory features
Real_Time_Features (2.0): Live dashboards, notifications, critical updates
AI_Integration_Points (2.0): New AI features touching existing healthcare systems
UI_UX_Healthcare (1.5): Healthcare professional interface modifications
Documentation_Only (1.0): Non-functional documentation updates
```

**Selected Reasoning**:
`Primary impact on Real-Time Features and AI Integration Points. Visual enhancement to appointment calendar with ML-powered insights affecting user experience and decision-making.`

### Final Risk Score

**Calculation**: `6 √ó 4 √ó 2.0 = 48`

**Risk Level**:

```
PASS (‚â§3): Low risk, standard review process
CONCERNS (4-6): Medium risk, enhanced monitoring required
FAIL (7-9): High risk, comprehensive mitigation mandatory
```

**Story Risk Level**: `CONCERNS (4-6) - MEDIUM RISK - ENHANCED MONITORING REQUIRED`

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Strategies

### Rollback Procedure

**Complexity**: `Medium`

**Step-by-Step Emergency Plan**:

1. `Disable ML risk score display via feature flag (immediate - 10 seconds)`
2. `Stop ML model inference processing for new appointments (15 seconds)`
3. `Clear risk score caches and reset appointment calendar to baseline display (30 seconds)`
4. `Verify existing appointment calendar functionality without risk indicators (1-2 minutes)`
5. `Reset patient data access patterns to pre-ML baseline (2 minutes)`
6. `Notify practice management team about temporary risk scoring unavailability (immediate)`

**Rollback Time Estimate**: `3-5 minutes to restore baseline appointment calendar`

### Monitoring Requirements
