6: Change affects shared healthcare utilities or common workflows  
3: Change affects isolated features with some healthcare integration
1: Change is completely isolated from existing healthcare functionality
```

**Selected Reasoning**: `High probability - Comprehensive ML system integration with appointment management, patient communication, and analytics systems. Multiple complex dependencies including ML model accuracy, automated intervention systems, and revenue-critical appointment workflows.`

### Impact Assessment (1-9)
**Score**: `6`

**Healthcare Workflow Consequences**:
```
9: System failure, patient data loss, compliance violation, medical workflow disruption
6: Healthcare feature broken, significant performance degradation affecting patient care
3: Minor healthcare functionality affected, recoverable issues, some workflow disruption
1: Cosmetic issues, non-critical performance impact, no healthcare workflow effect
```

**Selected Reasoning**: `Moderate-high impact - ML prediction errors could lead to inappropriate patient communication or missed intervention opportunities. Revenue-critical appointment management affected if prediction system fails, but core scheduling functionality preserved.`

### Decision Recommendation
**Proceed With**: `COMPREHENSIVE` **monitoring and gradual rollout with staged deployment**

**Rationale**: `Exceptional business value ($468,750+ annual revenue protection with 25% no-show reduction) justifies high-risk implementation with comprehensive monitoring. Staged rollout recommended starting with low-risk patient segments and limited intervention types. Strong ROI potential with manageable technical complexity through proper mitigation strategies.`

**Required Approvals**: `Practice Manager, Revenue Operations Director, Patient Communication Lead, LGPD Compliance Officer, and IT Security Director approval required before implementation`

**Staged Rollout Plan**:
- `Phase 1 (Week 1-2): ML risk scoring display only, no automated interventions`
- `Phase 2 (Week 3-4): Limited automated SMS interventions for high-confidence predictions`
- `Phase 3 (Week 5-6): Full intervention strategy automation with comprehensive monitoring`
- `Phase 4 (Week 7+): Analytics dashboard integration and optimization based on collected data`

**Healthcare Safety Note**: All automated interventions must maintain professional healthcare communication standards, respect patient autonomy, and include human oversight mechanisms. ML predictions should augment, not replace, professional judgment in patient care coordination.
