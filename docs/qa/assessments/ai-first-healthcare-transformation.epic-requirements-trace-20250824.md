   prevent urgent medical care access
   - **Risk Level**: High
   - **Healthcare Impact**: Could delay critical medical care if AI predictions interfere with
     emergency protocols
   - **Mitigation Plan**: Implement comprehensive emergency override testing and urgent care
     workflow validation

2. `AI Model Drift Detection and Bias Prevention`: Long-term AI accuracy monitoring and fairness
   validation
   - **Risk Level**: High
   - **Healthcare Impact**: Degraded AI performance could affect patient care quality and create
     unfair treatment patterns
   - **Mitigation Plan**: Establish continuous AI monitoring tests and bias detection automation

3. `Cross-Border AI Processing Compliance`: LGPD compliance for AI processing across different
   geographic regions
   - **Risk Level**: Medium
   - **Healthcare Impact**: Could create legal compliance issues for international patient data
     processing
   - **Mitigation Plan**: Implement jurisdiction-specific AI processing validation and data
     sovereignty testing

### Medium Priority Gaps

**Should Address Before Release**:

1. `Multi-Language Medical Terminology Support`: AI chat and medical information processing for
   diverse patient populations
   - **Impact**: Limited accessibility for non-Portuguese speaking patients
   - **Mitigation**: Expand AI training data and validation for multiple languages

2. `Partial AI Service Degradation Scenarios`: System behavior when some but not all AI services are
   unavailable
   - **Impact**: Unpredictable system behavior during partial outages
   - **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive service degradation testing matrix

### Low Priority Gaps

**Nice to Have Coverage**:

1. `AI Performance Impact on Legacy Workflow Efficiency`: Detailed measurement of AI enhancement vs
   potential slowdown
