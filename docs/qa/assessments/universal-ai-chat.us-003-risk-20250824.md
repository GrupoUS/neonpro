## üéØ Risk Scoring Matrix

### Probability Assessment (1-9)

**Score**: `6`

**Justification**:

```
9: Change touches critical healthcare code paths with complex dependencies
6: Change affects shared healthcare utilities or common workflows
3: Change affects isolated features with some healthcare integration
1: Change is completely isolated from existing healthcare functionality
```

**Selected Reasoning**:
`Moderate-high probability - Integration with appointment system and patient communication infrastructure creates dependencies. ML model accuracy and automated communication systems introduce complexity.`

### Impact Assessment (1-9)

**Score**: `5`

**Healthcare Workflow Consequences**:

```
9: System failure, patient data loss, compliance violation, medical workflow disruption
6: Healthcare feature broken, significant performance degradation affecting patient care
3: Minor healthcare functionality affected, recoverable issues, some workflow disruption
1: Cosmetic issues, non-critical performance impact, no healthcare workflow effect
```

**Selected Reasoning**:
`Moderate impact - Incorrect predictions could lead to inappropriate patient communication or missed interventions. Appointment workflow disruption possible if ML system fails, but core scheduling remains functional.`

### Healthcare Criticality Multiplier (1.0-3.0)

**Multiplier**: `2.5`

**Category Selection**:

```
Patient_Data_Systems (3.0): Patient registration, records, medical history
Appointment_Management (2.5): Scheduling, calendar, availability systems
Compliance_Reporting (2.5): LGPD/ANVISA/CFM regulatory features
Real_Time_Features (2.0): Live dashboards, notifications, critical updates
AI_Integration_Points (2.0): New AI features touching existing healthcare systems
UI_UX_Healthcare (1.5): Healthcare professional interface modifications
Documentation_Only (1.0): Non-functional documentation updates
```

**Selected Reasoning**:
`Primary impact on Appointment Management systems with ML-driven scheduling optimization. Affects revenue-critical appointment workflows and patient communication patterns.`

### Final Risk Score

**Calculation**: `6 √ó 5 √ó 2.5 = 75`

**Risk Level**:

```
PASS (‚â§3): Low risk, standard review process
CONCERNS (4-6): Medium risk, enhanced monitoring required
FAIL (7-9): High risk, comprehensive mitigation mandatory
```

**Story Risk Level**: `FAIL (7-9) - HIGH RISK - COMPREHENSIVE MITIGATION MANDATORY`

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Strategies

### Rollback Procedure

**Complexity**: `Medium`

**Step-by-Step Emergency Plan**:

1. `Disable ML prediction system via feature flag (immediate - 15 seconds)`
2. `Stop all automated patient interventions and communications (30 seconds)`
3. `Revert to manual appointment follow-up processes (1-2 minutes)`
4. `Clear ML prediction caches and reset appointment system to baseline (2 minutes)`
5. `Verify existing appointment booking and scheduling functionality (3-5 minutes)`
6. `Notify practice management team about temporary manual intervention requirement (immediate)`

**Rollback Time Estimate**: `5-10 minutes to restore manual processes`

### Monitoring Requirements

- `Develop patient communication preference management and consent system`

**During Development**:

- `Daily ML model accuracy validation with prediction confidence monitoring`
- `Continuous patient communication compliance testing`
- `Real-time intervention success rate tracking and optimization`

**Post-Implementation**:

- `14-day intensive monitoring with patient feedback collection and intervention adjustment`
- `Weekly ML model performance review and recalibration`
- `Monthly revenue impact analysis and ROI validation`

### Decision Recommendation

**Proceed With**: `ENHANCED` **monitoring with gradual rollout**

**Rationale**:
`High business value ($468,750+ annual revenue protection) justifies enhanced risk with comprehensive monitoring. Gradual rollout recommended starting with low-risk patient segments. Strong ROI potential with manageable technical complexity.`

**Required Approvals**:
`Practice Manager, Patient Communication Lead, LGPD Compliance Officer, and Revenue Operations approval required`

**Healthcare Safety Note**: Patient communication must maintain professional standards and respect
patient preferences. Any automated intervention must be reversible and include human oversight
mechanisms.
