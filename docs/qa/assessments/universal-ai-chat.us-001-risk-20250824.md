### Impact Assessment (1-9)

**Score**: `4`

**Healthcare Workflow Consequences**:

```
9: System failure, patient data loss, compliance violation, medical workflow disruption
6: Healthcare feature broken, significant performance degradation affecting patient care
3: Minor healthcare functionality affected, recoverable issues, some workflow disruption
1: Cosmetic issues, non-critical performance impact, no healthcare workflow effect
```

**Selected Reasoning**:
`Moderate impact - Chat widget failure could degrade patient experience and increase staff workload, but core healthcare workflows remain unaffected. Rollback via feature flag limits impact duration.`

### Healthcare Criticality Multiplier (1.0-3.0)

**Multiplier**: `1.5`

**Category Selection**:

```
Patient_Data_Systems (3.0): Patient registration, records, medical history
Appointment_Management (2.5): Scheduling, calendar, availability systems  
Compliance_Reporting (2.5): LGPD/ANVISA/CFM regulatory features
Real_Time_Features (2.0): Live dashboards, notifications, critical updates
AI_Integration_Points (2.0): New AI features touching existing healthcare systems
UI_UX_Healthcare (1.5): Healthcare professional interface modifications
Documentation_Only (1.0): Non-functional documentation updates
```

**Selected Reasoning**:
`Primary impact is UI/UX improvement for patient experience with some patient data handling. Not core medical workflow but involves patient interactions and basic appointment integration.`

### Final Risk Score

**Calculation**: `5 √ó 4 √ó 1.5 = 30`

**Risk Level**:

```
PASS (‚â§3): Low risk, standard review process
CONCERNS (4-6): Medium risk, enhanced monitoring required
FAIL (7-9): High risk, comprehensive mitigation mandatory
```
