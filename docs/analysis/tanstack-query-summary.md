   ```typescript
   // Convert from:
   useQuery({ queryKey: ['patients', id], queryFn: fetchPatient })
   
   // To:
   useQuery(patientQueries.detail(id)) // 100% type safe
   ```

2. **Add Developer Utilities**
   - Query debugging tools
   - Performance monitoring
   - Cache health analysis

### Phase 2: Performance Enhancements (Week 3-4)
1. **Optimistic Updates** for immediate UI feedback
2. **Intelligent Prefetching** for common workflows
