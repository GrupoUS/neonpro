## üéÆ QUICK START

### For Healthcare Developers with MCP Integration
`ash
# 1. Clone the NeonPro repository
git clone https://github.com/neonpro/neonpro.git
cd neonpro

# 2. Install monorepo dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Configure healthcare environment with MCP validation
cp .env.example .env.local
# Configure Supabase connection (Project: ownkoxryswokcdanrdgj)
# Add LGPD compliance keys and ANVISA integration tokens
# Verify MCP connections (tavily, exa, context7, sequential-thinking)

# 4. Setup healthcare database with MCP support
pnpm run db:migrate
pnpm run db:seed:healthcare

# 5. Run healthcare development server with MCP auto-activation
pnpm dev

# 6. Run compliance validation with MCP intelligence
pnpm run validate:healthcare
`

### Common Healthcare Tasks with MCP Orchestration
`ash
# Healthcare compliance testing with MCP research validation
pnpm run test:healthcare
pnpm run test:lgpd
pnpm run test:anvisa
pnpm run test:cfm

# MCP-enhanced development workflows
pnpm run mcp:research-healthcare    # Auto-activate research MCPs
pnpm run mcp:implement-feature      # Full MCP implementation pipeline
pnpm run mcp:validate-compliance    # Constitutional AI + MCP validation

# Build and deploy with MCP-enhanced compliance validation
pnpm run build:production

# Monitor healthcare metrics with MCP intelligence
pnpm run monitor:healthcare

# Generate compliance reports with MCP research enhancement
pnpm run report:compliance
