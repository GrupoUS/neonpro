# Feature Specification Workflow

## Description
Create feature specifications from natural language descriptions using template-driven approach with constitutional compliance for NeonPro healthcare platform.

## Category
Specification

## Complexity
Medium

## MCP Tools Required
- desktop-commander

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Initialization
1. **Setup Environment**
   - Execute setup script: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json "$ARGUMENTS"`
   - Parse JSON output for branch name and spec file path
   - Create and checkout new feature branch
   - Initialize specification file structure

2. **Template Loading**
   - Read spec template from `.specify/templates/spec-template.md`
   - Understand required sections and structure
   - Prepare placeholder replacement strategy
   - Validate template completeness

### Phase 2: Analysis and Understanding
1. **Feature Description Analysis**
   - Parse natural language feature description from arguments
   - Extract key requirements and objectives
   - Identify user stories and use cases
   - Map to healthcare domain context

2. **Constitutional Requirements Analysis**
   - Read constitution from `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
   - Extract constitutional commitments and requirements
   - Identify healthcare compliance constraints
   - Map architectural and quality requirements

### Phase 3: Specification Generation
1. **Template Structure Application**
   - Apply Feature Overview section with concrete details
   - Define Requirements section with specific technical needs
   - Create Technical Specifications with implementation details
   - Establish Acceptance Criteria with measurable outcomes
   - Document Implementation Notes with constraints and considerations

2. **Placeholder Replacement**
   - Replace all template placeholders with concrete details
   - Ensure all sections are properly filled
   - Add specific technical requirements and constraints
   - Include healthcare compliance considerations

3. **Constitutional Compliance Integration**
   - Apply KISS/YAGNI principles to specification
   - Ensure testable requirements and validation criteria
   - Include LGPD/ANVISA/CFM compliance requirements
   - Document architectural boundaries and constraints

### Phase 4: Validation and Quality Assurance
1. **Specification Completeness Check**
   - Verify all template sections are filled
   - Check for remaining placeholders or unclear sections
   - Validate that all requirements are testable
   - Ensure healthcare compliance is addressed

2. **Constitutional Validation**
   - Verify specification follows constitutional principles
   - Check architectural compliance and boundaries
   - Validate healthcare compliance requirements
   - Ensure observability and monitoring considerations

3. **Quality Gate Validation**
   - Check specification clarity and unambiguity
   - Validate that requirements are achievable
   - Ensure acceptance criteria are measurable
   - Verify that implementation constraints are realistic

### Phase 5: Documentation and Integration
1. **Specification Finalization**
   - Format specification document consistently
   - Add version control and metadata
   - Create executive summary and overview
   - Document assumptions and dependencies

2. **Repository Integration**
   - Commit specification file to feature branch
   - Create pull request for review
   - Link specification to related documentation
   - Set up tracking and monitoring

## Input Parameters
- **feature_description**: Natural language description of the feature to be specified
- **priority_level**: Development priority (low, medium, high, critical)
- **compliance_requirements**: Specific healthcare compliance needs
- **timeline_constraints**: Development timeline and deadlines

## Output Requirements
- **spec_file**: Complete feature specification document in markdown format
- **branch_name**: Feature branch created and checked out
- **validation_report**: Specification completeness and compliance validation
- **executive_summary**: High-level overview of the feature specification
- **compliance_document**: Healthcare compliance requirements and measures

## Quality Gates
- **Template Completeness**: All template sections filled with concrete details
- **Placeholder Replacement**: No remaining placeholders or unclear sections
- **Testability**: All requirements are testable with clear acceptance criteria
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Specification follows all constitutional principles
- **Healthcare Compliance**: All LGPD/ANVISA/CFM requirements addressed
- **Clarity**: Specification is clear, unambiguous, and actionable
- **Feasibility**: Requirements are achievable within constraints

## Error Handling
- **Template Loading Failure**: Abort with template path error and recovery steps
- **Script Execution Failure**: Abort with script error details and manual intervention required
- **Placeholder Replacement Failure**: Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] and continue
- **Constitutional Violations**: Report specific violations and require correction
- **Compliance Issues**: Highlight risks and propose mitigation strategies

## Success Criteria
- **Complete Specification**: All template sections filled with concrete details
- **Clear Requirements**: Unambiguous, testable requirements with acceptance criteria
- **Constitutional Compliance**: All constitutional principles followed in specification
- **Healthcare Compliance**: All LGPD/ANVISA/CFM requirements properly addressed
- **Ready for Development**: Specification is complete and ready for next phase
- **Branch Management**: Feature branch created and properly configured
- **Documentation**: Complete documentation with executive summary and compliance info

## Constitutional Compliance
- **KISS/YAGNI**: Requirements are simple and necessary, no over-engineering
- **Test-First**: All requirements have corresponding test definitions and acceptance criteria
- **Architecture**: Design follows established monorepo patterns and boundaries
- **Healthcare**: LGPD/ANVISA/CFM compliance integrated into all requirements
- **Observability**: Requirements include monitoring and logging needs

## Usage Examples
```bash
# Create specification for a new feature
cline workflow execute feature-specification --feature_description "Add patient appointment scheduling system"

# Create high-priority compliance feature specification
cline workflow execute feature-specification --feature_description "Implement LGPD consent management" --priority_level critical
```

## Integration Points
- **Desktop Commander**: File system operations, script execution, and repository management
- **Archon**: Potential integration for specification persistence and knowledge management
- **Serena**: Code analysis and validation for specification completeness and compliance
