# Security Gap Analysis Report
*Generated: $(date)*
*Project: NeonPro Telemedicine Platform*
*Phase: Security & Compliance Hardening*

## Executive Summary

This report identifies critical security vulnerabilities and compliance gaps discovered during the security infrastructure audit of the NeonPro telemedicine platform, particularly focusing on the newly implemented WebRTC functionality.

## Critical Security Gaps (Priority 1)

### 1. WebRTC Security Vulnerabilities
**Severity: CRITICAL**
**Compliance Impact: HIGH (LGPD, CFM)**

#### Issues Identified:
- **External STUN Dependency**: Using Google's public STUN servers creates privacy and availability risks
- **Missing TURN Infrastructure**: No TURN servers for NAT traversal in corporate environments
- **Unvalidated Data Channels**: No encryption verification for WebRTC data channels
- **Missing Connection Audit**: No audit logging for WebRTC connections

#### Compliance Risks:
- LGPD: Patient data potentially routed through external servers
- CFM: No guarantees of secure telemedicine sessions
- ANVISA: Medical device security requirements not met

#### Files Affected:
- `apps/web/src/hooks/use-webrtc.ts` (lines 15-24)
- `apps/web/src/hooks/use-telemedicine.ts` (lines 198-200)

### 2. Content Security Policy Weaknesses
**Severity: HIGH**
**Compliance Impact: MEDIUM**

#### Issues Identified:
- **XSS Vulnerability**: 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval' in script-src
- **Style Injection Risk**: 'unsafe-inline' in style-src
- **Missing Nonce Strategy**: No dynamic content protection
- **Incomplete CSP Reporting**: Basic reporting without proper validation

#### Files Affected:
- `apps/api/src/middleware/edge-runtime.ts` (lines 158-169)
- `api/csp-report.ts` (entire file)

## High Priority Gaps (Priority 2)

### 3. CORS Configuration Issues
**Severity: MEDIUM**
**Compliance Impact: LOW**

#### Issues Identified:
- **Development Wildcard**: CORS wildcard (*) in development could leak to production
- **Inconsistent Origins**: Multiple origin configurations across files
- **Missing Credential Validation**: Insufficient credential handling validation

#### Files Affected:
- `apps/api/src/app.ts` (lines 70-79)
- `apps/api/src/middleware/edge-runtime.ts` (lines 148-154)

### 4. Authentication & Authorization Gaps
**Severity: MEDIUM**
**Compliance Impact: HIGH (CFM)**

#### Issues Identified:
- **Missing WebRTC Auth**: No authentication validation for WebRTC connections
- **Incomplete Session Validation**: CFM professional validation not integrated with WebRTC
- **Missing Consent Tracking**: No LGPD consent for video/audio capture

## Medium Priority Gaps (Priority 3)

### 5. Audit & Logging Deficiencies
**Severity: MEDIUM**
**Compliance Impact: HIGH (LGPD, ANVISA)**

#### Issues Identified:
- **Missing WebRTC Audit**: No audit trail for video consultations
- **Incomplete Error Logging**: Security events not properly logged
- **Missing Compliance Reporting**: No automated compliance status reporting

### 6. Encryption & Key Management
**Severity: LOW**
**Compliance Impact: MEDIUM**

#### Issues Identified:
- **Key Rotation**: No automated key rotation strategy
- **Encryption Validation**: Missing runtime encryption verification
- **Backup Security**: Encrypted backup validation missing

## Compliance Gap Summary

### LGPD Compliance Gaps:
1. ❌ WebRTC external server data routing
2. ❌ Missing video/audio capture consent
3. ❌ Incomplete audit trail for patient interactions
4. ✅ Data anonymization implemented
5. ✅ Consent management service exists

### CFM Compliance Gaps:
1. ❌ No professional validation for WebRTC sessions
2. ❌ Missing secure telemedicine standards compliance
3. ❌ Incomplete session audit requirements
4. ✅ CFM compliance service implemented
5. ✅ Professional license validation exists

### ANVISA Compliance Gaps:
1. ❌ Medical device security standards not fully met
2. ❌ Missing adverse event reporting for security incidents
3. ❌ Incomplete device validation for WebRTC functionality
4. ✅ Medical device classification headers implemented
5. ✅ Basic adverse event reporting enabled

## Implementation Priority Matrix

| Gap Category | Severity | Compliance Impact | Implementation Effort | Priority |
|--------------|----------|-------------------|----------------------|----------|
| WebRTC Security | Critical | High | High | P1 |
| CSP Hardening | High | Medium | Medium | P1 |
| CORS Configuration | Medium | Low | Low | P2 |
| WebRTC Authentication | Medium | High | Medium | P2 |
| Audit Logging | Medium | High | Medium | P3 |
| Encryption Management | Low | Medium | Low | P3 |

## Recommended Remediation Timeline

**Week 1-2: Critical Fixes (P1)**
- Implement secure TURN/STUN infrastructure
- Harden CSP with nonce strategy
- Add WebRTC connection encryption validation

**Week 3-4: High Priority (P2)**
- Fix CORS configuration consistency
- Integrate CFM validation with WebRTC
- Implement LGPD consent for media capture

**Week 5-6: Medium Priority (P3)**
- Enhanced audit logging for all security events
- Automated compliance reporting
- Key rotation and encryption validation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All Critical and High severity gaps resolved
- [ ] 100% LGPD compliance for WebRTC functionality
- [ ] CFM professional validation integrated with telemedicine sessions
- [ ] ANVISA medical device security requirements met
- [ ] Comprehensive audit trail for all patient interactions
- [ ] Zero external dependencies for sensitive operations

## Next Steps

1. Begin P1 implementations immediately
2. Establish security testing for each fix
3. Create compliance validation checkpoints
4. Implement continuous security monitoring
