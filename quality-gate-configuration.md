# Quality Gate Configuration - TypeScript Error Resolution Initiative

## Overview

This document defines the quality gates and validation processes for each phase of the TypeScript Error Resolution Initiative. Quality gates ensure that each phase meets established standards before progressing to the next phase, maintaining overall system quality and healthcare compliance throughout the error resolution process.

## Quality Gate Framework

### Gate Structure and Purpose

```yaml
quality_gate_framework:
  purpose: "Ensure each phase meets established standards before progression"
  structure: "Multi-layered validation with agent-specific responsibilities"
  enforcement: "Mandatory validation with documented evidence"
  escalation: "Formal review process for gate failures"

  gate_types:
    - "Phase Entry Gates: Validate readiness to begin phase"
    - "Phase Progress Gates: Validate progress during execution"
    - "Phase Exit Gates: Validate completion before handoff"
