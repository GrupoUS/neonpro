# TDD Orchestrator - Multi-Agent Coordination Guide â€” Version: 2.0.0

## Overview

Elite TDD orchestrator that coordinates specialized code review agents throughout the complete test-driven development cycle. Masters red-green-refactor discipline while intelligently delegating tasks to architecture reviewers, code analyzers, security auditors, and test specialists. Ensures comprehensive quality assurance through systematic multi-agent workflows.

**Target Audience**: Development teams, TDD practitioners, AI agent coordinators
**Complexity Level**: Advanced (multi-agent orchestration)

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of TDD principles and red-green-refactor cycle
- Familiarity with code review processes and quality gates
- Access to code review agent suite:
  - [architect-review.md](./architect-review.md) - Architecture and system design
  - [code-reviewer.md](./code-reviewer.md) - Code quality and security analysis
  - [security-auditor.md](./security-auditor.md) - DevSecOps and compliance
  - [test.md](./test.md) - Test orchestration and patterns
- CI/CD pipeline integration capability
- Metrics and monitoring infrastructure

## Quick Start

### Basic Orchestration Command

```yaml
# Orchestrate complete TDD cycle for new feature
orchestrator: tdd-orchestrator
feature: "user-authentication"
agents:
  - architect-review    # Design validation

```

### 3. Microservices TDD Workflow

**Use Case**: Distributed systems, service boundaries, integration testing

```yaml
workflow: "microservices-tdd"
architecture_first: true
integration_focus: true

orchestration_pattern:
  service_boundary_analysis:
    agent: architect-review
    output: "Service contracts and boundaries"
  
  contract_testing:
    agent: test
    dependencies: [architect-review]
    output: "Contract tests and integration patterns"
  
  implementation_coordination:
    agents: [code-reviewer, security-auditor]
    parallel: true
    output: "Secure, quality implementation"
```

### 4. Legacy Code TDD Workflow

**Use Case**: Brownfield development, technical debt reduction

```yaml
workflow: "legacy-tdd"
safety_first: true
incremental_approach: true

phases:
  characterization:
    agents: [code-reviewer, test]
    goal: "Understand existing behavior"
  
  safety_net:
    agents: [test, architect-review]
    goal: "Create comprehensive test coverage"
  
  refactoring:
    coordination: architect-review
    agents: [code-reviewer, security-auditor, test]
    goal: "Safe incremental improvements"
```

## Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns

### 1. Sequential Delegation Pattern

**When to Use**: Linear dependencies, phase-based execution

```yaml
pattern: sequential
execution_order:
  1. architect-review    # Design validation
  2. security-auditor   # Security requirements
  3. test              # Test creation
  4. code-reviewer     # Implementation quality
```

### 2. Parallel Execution Pattern

**When to Use**: Independent analyses, time optimization

```yaml
pattern: parallel
concurrent_agents:
  analysis_group:
    - code-reviewer     # Code quality
    - security-auditor  # Security analysis
  validation_group:
    - architect-review  # Design compliance
    - test             # Test validation
```

### 3. Hierarchical Coordination Pattern

**When to Use**: Complex orchestration, master-slave relationships

```yaml
pattern: hierarchical
coordinator: tdd-orchestrator
sub_coordinators:
  quality_coordinator:
    agents: [code-reviewer, test]
    focus: "Quality assurance"
  
  security_coordinator:
    agents: [security-auditor]
    focus: "Security validation"
  
  architecture_coordinator:
    agents: [architect-review]
    focus: "Design compliance"
```

### 4. Event-Driven Activation Pattern

**When to Use**: Dynamic agent selection, context-sensitive activation

```yaml
pattern: event_driven
triggers:
  security_keywords: ["auth", "payment", "personal", "encrypt"]
  architecture_keywords: ["microservice", "api", "integration"]
  quality_keywords: ["performance", "refactor", "technical debt"]

activation_rules:
  if_security_detected:
    primary: security-auditor
    support: [code-reviewer, test]
  
  if_architecture_detected:
    primary: architect-review
    support: [code-reviewer, security-auditor]
```

## Communication & Integration Protocols

### Inter-Agent Communication

```yaml
COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL:
  message_format:
    sender: agent_name
    receiver: agent_name | "broadcast"
    type: "analysis" | "recommendation" | "validation"
    priority: "low" | "medium" | "high" | "critical"
    context: 
      phase: "red" | "green" | "refactor"
      feature: string
      files: array
    payload: object
  
  shared_context:
    feature_spec: "Common understanding of requirements"
    code_changes: "Current implementation state"  
    test_suite: "Test coverage and results"
    quality_metrics: "Code quality measurements"
    security_findings: "Vulnerabilities and compliance status"
```

### Agent State Management

```typescript
interface OrchestrationState {
  feature: {
    name: string;
    complexity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
    domain: string[];

  tdd_cycle: {
    phase: 'red' | 'green' | 'refactor';
    iteration: number;
    test_status: 'failing' | 'passing' | 'optimizing';
  };
  
  agents: {
    active: AgentName[];
    completed: AgentName[];
    pending: AgentName[];
    failed: AgentName[];
  };
  
  quality_gates: {
    architecture: QualityGateStatus;
    security: QualityGateStatus;
    code_quality: QualityGateStatus;
    test_coverage: QualityGateStatus;
  };
}
```

### Tool Integration Points

```yaml

## Troubleshooting

### Common Orchestration Issues

| Issue | Symptoms | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Agent Coordination Conflicts** | Multiple agents making contradictory recommendations | Implement priority hierarchy and conflict resolution protocols |
| **Workflow Performance Degradation** | TDD cycles taking significantly longer | Optimize agent selection and parallel execution patterns |
| **Quality Gate Failures** | Consistent failures in specific quality gates | Review gate thresholds and agent effectiveness |
| **Context Loss Between Phases** | Agents losing shared context during phase transitions | Strengthen state management and context persistence |
| **Agent Selection Suboptimal** | Wrong agents activated for feature type | Refine trigger keywords and selection algorithms |

### Debugging Orchestration Flows

```bash
# Enable orchestration debugging
export TDD_ORCHESTRATOR_DEBUG=true
export AGENT_COMMUNICATION_LOG=verbose

# Trace agent activation
tdd-orchestrator trace --feature="user-auth" --workflow="security-critical"

# Validate agent coordination
tdd-orchestrator validate --agents="security-auditor,code-reviewer" --phase="green"

# Performance profiling
tdd-orchestrator profile --workflow="microservices-tdd" --iterations=10
```

### Agent Communication Diagnostics

```typescript
interface CommunicationDiagnostics {
  message_flow: {
    sent: number;
    received: number;
    failed: number;
  };
  
  coordination_issues: {
    conflicts: ConflictReport[];
    timeouts: TimeoutReport[];
    state_sync_failures: StateSyncError[];
  };
  
  performance_metrics: {
    average_response_time: number;
    agent_utilization: Record<string, number>;
    workflow_bottlenecks: string[];
  };
}
```

## Next Steps

### After Orchestration Setup

1. **Configure Monitoring**:
   - Set up orchestration metrics dashboard
   - Configure alerting for quality gate failures
   - Implement agent performance tracking

2. **Team Training**:
   - Conduct orchestration workflow training
   - Establish agent coordination best practices
   - Create troubleshooting runbooks

3. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Collect orchestration effectiveness data
   - Refine agent selection algorithms
   - Optimize workflow patterns based on results

4. **Integration Expansion**:
   - Add more specialized agents as needed
   - Integrate with additional development tools
   - Expand to other development methodologies

### Scaling Orchestration

- **Multi-Team Coordination**: Extend orchestration across multiple development teams
- **Cross-Repository Workflows**: Coordinate TDD across multiple repositories
- **Advanced AI Integration**: Incorporate ML-based agent selection and optimization
