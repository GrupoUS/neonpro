# NeonPro Brand Assets

Place the official NeonPro symbol PNG here to be served by the web app.

Expected files:
- `apps/web/public/brand/simboloneonpro.png`
- `apps/web/public/brand/iconeneonpro.png`

How to add:
1. Copy your files `simboloneonpro.png` and `iconeneonpro.png` into this folder.
2. Recommended size: `simboloneonpro.png` 512x512 or larger (square), `iconeneonpro.png` 64-128px (square), both with transparent background.
3. Keep the filenames exactly as above so the app can reference `/brand/simboloneonpro.png` and `/brand/iconeneonpro.png`.

After placing the files, run the dev server and confirm:
- Logo appears in the sidebar and on login pages.
- AI chat opener and header show the AI icon.
