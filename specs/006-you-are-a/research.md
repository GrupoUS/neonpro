## Technology Stack Deep Dive

### React 19 + TanStack Router v5 Best Practices

**Key Findings from Official Documentation**:

1. **Concurrent Architecture Impact**:
   - React 19's async transitions enable automatic pending states and error handling
   - Optimistic updates require specific boundary analysis in monorepo structure
   - Server Components patterns affect package organization strategies

2. **TanStack Router Advanced Features**:
   - **Auto Code Splitting**: Automatically splits route components based on configuration
   - **Parallel Routes**: Enable independent route loading for complex UI patterns
   - **Type-Safe Navigation**: End-to-end type safety across route boundaries
   - **File-Based Organization**: Affects monorepo structure analysis approaches

**Source**: TanStack Router official documentation confirms:
> "When using the autoCodeSplitting feature, TanStack Router will automatically code split your route files based on the non-critical route configuration."

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Analyze route structure for code splitting opportunities
- Identify parallel route patterns for complex UI layouts
- Validate type safety across route boundaries
- Assess component placement strategies (apps/web vs packages/ui)

### Hono + tRPC v11 Edge-First Architecture

**Integration Patterns from Official Research**:

1. **Edge Runtime Benefits**:
   - Hono provides ultra-fast, fetch-native API responses
   - tRPC v11 enables end-to-end type safety without GraphQL overhead
   - Edge-first deployment affects package boundary analysis

2. **Architecture Patterns**:
   - **CRUD reads**: Direct Supabase access (bypass tRPC when appropriate)
   - **Business rules**: tRPC procedures for side effects and validation
   - **Mixed runtime**: Edge for reads, Node for sensitive operations

**Source**: tRPC v11 announcement (March 2025):
> "v11 is a largely backward-compatible release with v10, but it brings a lot of new features and improvements."

**Analysis Implications**:
- Package boundaries should reflect runtime separation concerns
- tRPC procedure organization affects API layer analysis
- Edge vs Node runtime decisions impact architectural patterns

### Supabase + TypeScript Integration Patterns

**Monorepo Best Practices**:

1. **Type Generation Strategy**:
   - Use `supabase gen types` for automated type generation
   - Publish shared types to `@neonpro/types` package
   - Implement Zod validation for runtime type safety

2. **Realtime Integration**:
   - Postgres Changes → client subscriptions
   - TanStack Query cache invalidation patterns
   - Optimistic updates with rollback strategies

3. **RLS and Security Patterns**:
   - Row Level Security enforces tenant isolation
   - Service role key usage restricted to Node runtime
   - JWT carries `clinic_id` and `role` for access control

**Source**: Supabase TypeScript best practices emphasize:
> "Centralized types: Consider creating a shared types package for common interfaces"

**Architectural Analysis Focus**:
- Validate proper type sharing across package boundaries
- Assess realtime integration patterns
- Review RLS policy implementation consistency
- Analyze security boundary implementations

## Monorepo Optimization Strategies

### Turborepo 2025 Best Practices

**Performance Optimization Findings**:

1. **Advanced Caching Strategies**:
   - Intelligent caching reduces build times by up to 80%
   - Task dependency analysis enables incremental builds
   - Remote caching capabilities enhance CI/CD performance

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Use single package manager (Bun preferred, PNPM fallback)
   - Leverage workspace protocols for internal dependencies
   - Implement hoisting strategies for optimal bundle sizes

**Source**: Turborepo 2025 research confirms:
> "Turborepo does caching: when you're running tests or building your monorepo, only those packages that changed will be re-tested or re-built."

**Analysis Applications**:
- Evaluate current Turborepo configuration for optimization opportunities
- Assess task dependency definitions for accuracy
- Identify caching strategy improvements
- Review package manager consistency

### Package Organization Patterns

**Modern Monorepo Structure (2025 Best Practices)**:

```
packages/
├── @neonpro/ui          # Reusable UI components with theming
├── @neonpro/core        # Shared hooks and utilities
├── @neonpro/types       # Centralized TypeScript definitions
├── @neonpro/config      # Shared configuration and constants
├── @neonpro/database    # Supabase helpers and types
└── @neonpro/agents      # AI agent integrations
```

**Boundary Analysis Considerations**:
- Package responsibility boundaries and overlaps
- Cross-package dependency patterns
- Export/import consistency
- Circular dependency detection

## Code Duplication Detection Techniques

### Modern Static Analysis Tools

**Cutting-Edge Detection Methods**:

1. **jscpd (Copy/Paste Detector)**:
   - Supports 150+ programming languages
   - Configurable similarity thresholds
   - Integration with CI/CD pipelines

2. **SMART TS XL**:
   - TypeScript-specific analysis
   - Real-time, type-aware duplicate detection
   - Precise identification of similar patterns

3. **SonarQube Integration**:

   - Technical debt quantification
   - Trend analysis and monitoring

**Source**: Modern static analysis research confirms:
> "Use tools like Bazel or Turborepo to handle dependencies within the monorepo. SonarQube is a static analysis tool that identifies code smells, bugs, and..."

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Implement jscpd for initial duplicate detection
- Use SMART TS XL for TypeScript-specific analysis
- Integrate SonarQube for ongoing quality monitoring
