# Implementation Plan: Comprehensive Monorepo Architecture Analysis

**Branch**: `006-you-are-a` | **Date**: 2025-01-30 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/006-you-are-a/spec.md`
**Enhanced with**: Official documentation research and proven best practices

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Comprehensive architectural analysis of NeonPro monorepo to identify code duplication, architectural violations, and organizational issues. Based on official documentation research for React 19, TanStack Router v5, Hono + tRPC v11, and modern monorepo best practices. The analysis will deliver evidence-based improvement proposals with ROI analysis and phased implementation roadmap.

**Testing**: Vitest 3.x (unit/integration), Playwright 1.4x (E2E)  
**Target Platform**: Vercel Edge Functions (reads) + Node Functions (writes)  
**Project Type**: Web application (monorepo with frontend + backend + shared packages)  
**Performance Goals**: Edge TTFB <150ms, Realtime UI updates <1.5s, Build performance 80% improvement  
**Constraints**: <2s cold dev start, 99.9% uptime, LGPD/ANVISA compliance  
**Scale/Scope**: Brazilian aesthetic clinics, 50+ packages/components, 10k+ LOC analysis

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Confirmed by Technical Context with frontend + backend + shared packages

## Phase 0: Outline & Research ✅ COMPLETED
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - ✅ React 19 + TanStack Router v5 integration patterns
   - ✅ Hono + tRPC v11 edge-first architecture patterns
   - ✅ Supabase + TypeScript monorepo best practices
   - ✅ Turborepo 2025 optimization strategies
   - ✅ Modern code duplication detection techniques

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   ✅ Researched React 19 concurrent architecture impact
   ✅ Researched TanStack Router advanced features (code splitting, parallel routes)
   ✅ Researched Hono + tRPC v11 integration patterns
   ✅ Researched Turborepo caching and optimization strategies
   ✅ Researched modern static analysis tools (jscpd, SMART TS XL, SonarQube)
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - **Decision**: Evidence-based approach with official documentation
   - **Rationale**: Multi-source validation with ≥95% accuracy
   - **Alternatives considered**: Multiple tools and patterns evaluated

**Output**: ✅ research.md with comprehensive official documentation findings and proven best practices

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete ✅*

1. **Extract analysis entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - **Analysis Components**: Codebase analysis entities, issue inventory structure, architectural patterns
   - **Validation Rules**: Quality thresholds, architectural compliance criteria, severity classifications
   - **State Transitions**: Analysis workflow states, issue resolution paths

2. **Generate analysis API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - **Analysis Endpoints**: Duplicate detection, architectural validation, performance monitoring
   - **Data Export APIs**: Issue inventory export, visualization data, metrics endpoints
   - **Contract Schemas**: Standardized analysis result formats, severity definitions
   - Output JSON schemas to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate analysis contract tests** from contracts:
   - **Duplicate Detection Tests**: Test jscpd, SMART TS XL integration
   - **Architectural Validation Tests**: Package boundary, dependency graph, type safety
   - **Performance Monitoring Tests**: Build time, bundle size, development experience
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - **Story Validation**: Each user story → integration test scenario
   - **Quality Gate Testing**: Threshold validation, automated quality checks
   - **Quickstart Test**: End-to-end analysis workflow validation

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh kilocode`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each analysis contract → analysis test task [P]
- Each analysis entity → analysis model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Analysis-Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Code Duplication Detection Tasks**:
   - jscpd integration and configuration
   - SMART TS XL TypeScript-specific analysis
   - SonarQube integration for ongoing monitoring
   - Custom duplicate detection for NeonPro patterns

2. **Architectural Validation Tasks**:
   - Package boundary analysis automation
   - Dependency graph validation
   - TypeScript strict mode compliance checking
   - Import/export cycle detection

3. **Performance Analysis Tasks**:
   - Turborepo optimization implementation
   - Bundle size analysis and optimization
   - Build performance monitoring
   - Development experience improvements

4. **Visualization and Reporting Tasks**:
   - Issue inventory generation
   - Architectural diagram creation
   - ROI analysis implementation
   - Executive summary automation

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **TDD order**: Analysis tests before implementation 
- **Dependency order**: Tool setup → configuration → analysis → reporting
- **Risk-based order**: Critical issues detection first
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent analysis tools)

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
