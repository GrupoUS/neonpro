# Tasks: Comprehensive Monorepo Architecture Analysis

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/006-you-are-a/`
**Prerequisites**: Enhanced plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/analysis-api.json, quickstart.md
**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks for complete analysis and implementation
**Scope**: NeonPro monorepo with React 19, TanStack Router v5, Hono + tRPC v11, Supabase

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load enhanced plan.md from feature directory ✅
   → Extract: React 19, TanStack Router v5, Hono + tRPC v11, Supabase patterns
2. Load comprehensive design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract CodebaseAnalysis, Finding, PackageAnalysis entities
   → contracts/analysis-api.json: Extract analysis endpoints and schemas
   → research.md: Extract React 19 concurrent patterns, Turborepo optimizations
   → quickstart.md: Extract analysis workflow and validation scenarios
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Analysis tools, environment preparation, Turborepo optimization
   → Tests: Contract tests, integration tests, analysis validation
   → Core: Analysis models, duplication detection, architectural validation
   → Integration: Reporting, visualization, executive summary
   → Polish: Performance optimization, documentation, stakeholder delivery
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel execution
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD approach)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph for architectural analysis workflow
7. Create parallel execution examples for analysis tools
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All analysis contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All analysis endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

- Core Models (T016-T019) block Analysis Services (T020-T027)
- Analysis Services (T020-T027) block API Implementation (T028-T035)
- API Implementation (T028-T035) blocks Workflow (T036-T041)
- All Implementation before Polish (T047-T054)

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 3.1 - Setup Parallel Tasks:

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- Verify tests fail before implementing corresponding functionality (TDD approach)
- Commit after each task completion with meaningful commit messages
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, skipping test validation
- Focus on Brazilian aesthetic clinic compliance throughout implementation
- Maintain KISS and YAGNI principles - implement only what's needed

## Task Generation Rules Applied
1. **From Contracts**: Each analysis endpoint → contract test task [P] + implementation task
2. **From Data Model**: Each entity (CodebaseAnalysis, Finding, PackageAnalysis) → model creation task [P]
3. **From Research**: React 19, TanStack Router v5, Turborepo optimizations → analysis service tasks
4. **From User Stories**: Each analysis scenario → integration test [P]
5. **From Quickstart**: Each analysis phase → validation and workflow tasks

## Validation Checklist ✅
- [x] All analysis contracts have corresponding tests
- [x] All entities have model creation tasks
- [x] All tests come before implementation (TDD approach)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Brazilian aesthetic clinic compliance integrated throughout
- [x] Modern tooling (jscpd, SonarQube, SMART TS XL) properly integrated
- [x] React 19 + TanStack Router v5 analysis patterns included
- [x] Performance optimization and Turborepo improvements addressed
