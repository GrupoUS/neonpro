# Feature Specification: Comprehensive Monorepo Architecture Analysis

**Feature Branch**: `006-you-are-a`  
**Created**: 2025-01-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "You are a senior software architect specializing in monorepo architectures with expertise in vite, React, hono, tanstack router e query, turbo repo, TypeScript, and modern frontend tooling. Your task is to perform a comprehensive, systematic analysis of the provided codebase to identify architectural issues, code duplication, redundancy, and organizational problems, then propose concrete improvements aligned with established architectural patterns and best practices.

## Analysis Framework

### Phase 1: Architecture Documentation Review
**Objective**: Establish architectural baseline and constraints
- **Primary Sources**: Analyze all documents in `@/docs/architecture/` to understand:
  - Project structure and layer definitions (frontend, backend, shared packages)
  - Module responsibilities and boundaries
  - Monorepo configuration (Turborepo/bun workspaces)
  - Established patterns and conventions
- **Review Criteria**: Consult `@/.claude/agents/code-review/architect-review.md` for:
  - SOLID principles compliance
  - DRY principle violations
  - Separation of concerns
  - Scalability patterns
  - Design pattern adherence

### Phase 2: Codebase Deep Dive Analysis
**Target Directories**:
- **Frontend App**: `/home/vibecode/neonpro/apps/web/src/`
  - Components architecture and reusability
  - Page structure and routing patterns
  - Custom hooks implementation and usage
  - State management patterns
  - API integration approaches
- **Shared Packages**: `/home/vibecode/neonpro/packages/`
  - Package boundaries and responsibilities
  - Cross-package dependencies
  - Export/import patterns
  - Type definitions and interfaces

**Critical Issues to Identify**:
1. **Code Duplication**:
   - Identical or near-identical functions/components across locations
   - Duplicated business logic between apps and packages
   - Repeated validation schemas or utility functions
   - Similar custom hooks with slight variations

2. **Architectural Violations**:
   - Business logic leaking into presentation components
   - Direct database/API calls in UI components
   - Circular dependencies between packages
   - Improper abstraction levels

3. **Misplaced Code**:
   - UI components in business logic packages
   - Shared utilities buried in app-specific directories
   - Configuration scattered across multiple locations /home/vibecode/neonpro/docs/architecture/source-tree.md
   - Type definitions not properly centralized

### Phase 3: Technology Stack Assessment
**Current Stack Analysis**:
- **Core Technologies**:  /home/vibecode/neonpro/docs/architecture/tech-stack.md
- **Tooling**: Identify build tools, linting, testing frameworks
- **State Management**: Detect patterns (Zustand, Redux, Context API)
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS, Tailwind CSS, or other approaches
- **Data Fetching**: React Query, SWR, or native fetch patterns

**Best Practices Validation**:
analise o /home/vibecode/neonpro/docs/architecture/tech-stack.md para entender
- **TypeScript**: Type safety, interface design, generic usage

### Phase 4: Architectural Improvement Proposals
**Reorganization Strategy**:
- **Package Structure Optimization**:
  - `@neonpro/ui` - Reusable UI components with proper theming
  - `@neonpro/core` - Shared custom hooks with proper abstractions and Pure utility functions and helpers
  - `@neonpro/types` - Centralized type definitions
  - `@neonpro/config` - Shared configuration and constants

**Frontend Architecture Enhancements**:
- **Routing Optimization**: Leverage tanstack router features (parallel routes, intercepting routes, route groups)
- **Component Architecture**: where is the best place to be? /home/vibecode/neonpro/packages/ui/src/components or  /home/vibecode/neonpro/apps/web/src/components
- **Hook Strategy**: Create reusable, testable hooks with proper dependency injection
- **Performance**: Implement proper code splitting, lazy loading, and caching strategies

**Integration Patterns**:
- **Build System**: Optimize Turborepo configuration for efficient builds
- **Type Safety**: Ensure end-to-end type safety across package boundaries
- **Testing Strategy**: Implement comprehensive testing at package and integration levels

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **NeonPro Aesthetic Clinic Compliance**: Consider these mandatory requirements:
   - Brazilian aesthetic clinic regulations (LGPD, ANVISA, relevant professional councils)
   - Client data protection and privacy for aesthetic procedures
   - AI-powered prevention capabilities for no-show reduction
   - Mobile-first Brazilian experience for all aesthetic professionals
   - Type safety and data integrity for clinic operations
5. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions (clinic owners, aesthetic professionals, coordinators)
   - Data retention/deletion policies for client information
   - Performance targets and scale for aesthetic clinic workflows
   - Error handling behaviors specific to aesthetic procedures
   - Integration requirements for aesthetic clinic management
   - Security/compliance needs for cosmetic products and equipment
   - Aesthetic clinic compliance requirements

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a development team lead, I need a comprehensive architectural analysis of our NeonPro monorepo to identify technical debt, code duplication, and organizational issues so that we can improve code quality, reduce maintenance overhead, and ensure our architecture supports future growth for Brazilian aesthetic clinics.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the current monorepo structure with frontend app and shared packages, **When** the architectural analysis is completed, **Then** all code duplications are identified with exact locations and impact assessments
2. **Given** existing documentation in `/docs/architecture/`, **When** compared against actual codebase implementation, **Then** all architectural violations are documented with severity levels and proposed solutions
3. **Given** the current package structure, **When** analyzed for reorganization opportunities, **Then** a clear roadmap for package optimization is presented with ROI analysis
4. **Given** identified issues, **When** prioritized by business impact and technical debt, **Then** a phased implementation plan is provided with quick wins and long-term improvements

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the analysis discovers critical architectural flaws that require immediate attention?
- How does the analysis handle conflicting architectural patterns between different parts of the system?
- What if the current documentation significantly differs from actual implementation?
- How are recommendations prioritized when multiple issues have similar severity levels?
