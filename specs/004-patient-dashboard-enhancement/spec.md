## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a clinic staff member, I need an enhanced patient dashboard that provides AI-powered insights and real-time updates on my mobile device, so I can make informed decisions about patient care, predict no-shows, and access critical patient information instantly during consultations and between appointments.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a logged-in clinic staff member, **When** I access the patient dashboard on my smartphone, **Then** I see a mobile-optimized interface with key patient metrics, upcoming appointments, and AI-generated insights within 500ms
2. **Given** I am viewing a patient's profile, **When** the AI system detects a high no-show probability, **Then** I receive a real-time alert with suggested interventions to prevent the cancellation
3. **Given** I am in a patient consultation, **When** I need to access treatment history, **Then** I can quickly view chronological treatment records with AI-highlighted patterns and recommendations
4. **Given** I am managing my daily schedule, **When** real-time updates occur (new appointments, cancellations, patient arrivals), **Then** the dashboard automatically refreshes without requiring manual refresh

### Edge Cases
- What happens when AI predictions have low confidence scores?
- How does the system handle dashboard access during poor mobile network conditions?
- What occurs when multiple staff members view the same patient simultaneously?
- How does the system behave when AI services are temporarily unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
