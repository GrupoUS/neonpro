# Phase 0: Research & Decision Analysis

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. shadcn CLI Theme Installation Best Practices
**Decision**: Use `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [URL]` with manual adjustments
**Rationale**: CLI provides standardized installation but requires manual tweaks for monorepo structure
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Pure manual installation (too error-prone)
- Bun-based installation (conflicts with pnpm workspace preference)

### 2. Monorepo Theme Integration Strategy
**Decision**: Install theme in packages directory for shared consumption
**Rationale**: Centralized theme management ensures consistency across all apps and reduces duplication
**Alternatives considered**:
- App-specific theme installations (violates DRY principle)
- Root-level theme (doesn't leverage workspace properly)

### 3. Font Loading Optimization
**Decision**: Local font installation for Inter, Lora, Libre Baskerville
**Rationale**: Better performance, privacy compliance, and offline capability for Brazilian clinics
**Alternatives considered**:
- Google Fonts via next/font (external dependency)
- CDN-based loading (privacy concerns for LGPD)

### 4. Theme State Management
**Decision**: Context API + localStorage for light/dark mode persistence
**Rationale**: Provides global state management with user preference persistence across sessions
**Alternatives considered**:
- CSS-only with media queries (no user preference persistence)
- System preference only (limits user control)

### 5. Configuration Management
**Decision**: Configure theme in packages/ui with symlinks to all apps
**Rationale**: Shared configuration ensures consistency while allowing app-specific overrides when needed
**Alternatives considered**:
- Root-level configuration (less flexible for app-specific needs)
- Duplicate configurations per app (maintenance nightmare)

## Technology Research

### shadcn CLI Theme Integration
- **Source**: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming
- **Key Finding**: CLI supports registry URLs but requires manual configuration for monorepo
- **Best Practice**: Use CLI for base installation, manually adjust for workspace structure

### Tailwind CSS Integration
- **Source**: Tailwind CSS documentation
- **Key Finding**: CSS variables in oklch format provide better color control
- **Best Practice**: Centralize CSS variables in globals.css with proper scoping

### Next.js Font Optimization
- **Source**: Next.js documentation
- **Key Finding**: Local fonts provide better performance and privacy
- **Best Practice**: Use next/font with local font files for optimal loading

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
- **Source**: W3C WCAG guidelines
- **Key Finding**: Color contrast ratios must meet 4.5:1 for normal text
- **Best Practice**: Use oklch color format for better accessibility control

## Constitutional Compliance Assessment

### ✅ Aesthetic Clinic Compliance
- Theme supports Brazilian aesthetic clinic visual requirements
- Color schemes appropriate for professional medical aesthetic context
- Font choices optimized for readability in clinical settings

### ✅ Type Safety & Data Integrity
- Full TypeScript integration with theme types
- Strict configuration validation
- No runtime configuration errors

### ✅ Performance & Reliability
- Local font loading ensures fast performance
- Optimized CSS variable system
- Minimal runtime overhead for theme switching

### ✅ Privacy by Design
- Local font installation respects data residency
- No external font dependencies
- User preferences stored locally (no server transmission)

## Research Summary

All critical unknowns have been resolved through research. The approach aligns with NeonPro constitutional requirements and provides a solid foundation for implementation. Key decisions prioritize monorepo efficiency, Brazilian compliance, and performance optimization for aesthetic clinic workflows.
