# Tasks: NEONPRO Theme + UI Components Integration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-continue-aprimorando-o/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md, and UI components integration from consolidated 002 specification

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
   → quickstart.md: Extract installation steps → implementation tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: registry configuration, dependencies, workspace setup
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests, validation tests
   → Core: theme installation, font setup, component integration
   → Integration: theme provider, symlinks, configuration management
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs, troubleshooting
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```
