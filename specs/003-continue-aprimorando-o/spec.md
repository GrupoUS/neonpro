## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **NeonPro Aesthetic Clinic Compliance**: Consider these mandatory requirements:
   - Brazilian aesthetic clinic regulations (LGPD, ANVISA, relevant professional councils)
   - Client data protection and privacy for aesthetic procedures
   - AI-powered prevention capabilities for no-show reduction
   - Mobile-first Brazilian experience for all aesthetic professionals
   - Type safety and data integrity for clinic operations
5. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions (clinic owners, aesthetic professionals, coordinators)
   - Data retention/deletion policies for client information
   - Performance targets and scale for aesthetic clinic workflows
   - Error handling behaviors specific to aesthetic procedures
   - Integration requirements for aesthetic clinic management
   - Security/compliance needs for cosmetic products and equipment
   - Aesthetic clinic compliance requirements

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the NeonPro aesthetic clinic platform, I need to install and configure the NEONPRO theme system along with 7 specific UI components (Shine Border, Kokonut Gradient Button, Aceternity Hover Border Gradient Button, Magic Card, Animated Theme Toggler, Tilted Card, and Aceternity UI Sidebar), ensuring all components work seamlessly together with consistent visual styling across the monorepo applications while maintaining professional appearance and meeting aesthetic clinic industry standards.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the NEONPRO theme is installed and configured, **When** installing the 7 UI components, **Then** all components must inherit NEONPRO brand colors and design tokens
2. **Given** the monorepo structure with shared packages, **When** theme and components are installed, **Then** they must be accessible from all apps via packages/ui
3. **Given** multiple UI libraries are being integrated, **When** installation is complete, **Then** there must be no dependency conflicts or version mismatches
4. **Given** the existing theme system, **When** using the new components, **Then** light/dark mode switching must work consistently across all components
5. **Given** the healthcare aesthetic clinic context, **When** all components are integrated, **Then** they must maintain WCAG 2.1 AA+ accessibility compliance
6. **Given** the theme installation process, **When** following the installation guide, **Then** all CSS variables, fonts, and color schemes are properly integrated and available across all apps
7. **Given** the theme and components are configured, **When** users toggle between light and dark modes, **Then** all applications in the monorepo reflect the theme change consistently with aesthetic clinic-appropriate contrast ratios

### Edge Cases
- What happens when theme installation conflicts with existing CSS variables?
- How does the system handle font loading failures or network connectivity issues?
- What occurs when the theme registry is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system maintain theme consistency when new apps are added to the monorepo?
- What happens when dependency conflicts occur during theme installation?
- How does system handle font loading failures for Inter, Lora, or Libre Baskerville?
- What occurs when existing Tailwind configurations conflict with theme settings?
- How does installation proceed when network issues prevent accessing the theme registry?
- What happens when a component requires conflicting versions of Framer Motion?
- How does the system handle icon library conflicts between Lucide and Tabler icons?
- What occurs when CSS variable naming conflicts arise between components?

### Key Entities _(theme and component configuration entities)_

#### Theme Configuration Entities
- **Theme Configuration**: Represents the styling settings, CSS variables, and font configurations that apply across all applications
