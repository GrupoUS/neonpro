## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **NeonPro Aesthetic Clinic Compliance**: Consider these mandatory requirements:
   - Brazilian aesthetic clinic regulations (LGPD, ANVISA, relevant professional councils)
   - Client data protection and privacy for aesthetic procedures
   - AI-powered prevention capabilities for no-show reduction
   - Mobile-first Brazilian experience for all aesthetic professionals
   - Type safety and data integrity for clinic operations
5. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions (clinic owners, aesthetic professionals, coordinators)
   - Data retention/deletion policies for client information
   - Performance targets and scale for aesthetic clinic workflows
   - Error handling behaviors specific to aesthetic procedures
   - Integration requirements for aesthetic clinic management
   - Security/compliance needs for cosmetic products and equipment
   - Aesthetic clinic compliance requirements

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the NeonPro aesthetic clinic platform, I need to permanently install and configure the NEONPRO theme system, ensuring it is fully integrated into the Next.js monorepo with all styling, fonts, and functionality working across all applications and pages.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Next.js monorepo with shadcn UI setup, **When** following the installation guide, **Then** the NEONPRO theme is successfully integrated with all styling applied
2. **Given** the theme is installed, **When** viewing any application in the monorepo, **Then** theme styles (colors, fonts, shadows) are consistently applied
3. **Given** the theme is configured, **When** testing light/dark mode toggle, **Then** both modes display correctly with proper color schemes
4. **Given** the installation process, **When** running verification steps, **Then** all CSS variables are properly loaded and accessible

### Edge Cases
- What happens when dependency conflicts occur during theme installation?
- How does system handle font loading failures for Inter, Lora, or Libre Baskerville?
- What occurs when existing Tailwind configurations conflict with theme settings?
- How does installation proceed when network issues prevent accessing the theme registry?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST install NEONPRO theme via CLI + manual adjustments using `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [URL]`
- **FR-002**: System MUST install theme in packages directory for shared consumption across all monorepo apps
- **FR-003**: System MUST configure local font installation for Inter, Lora, and Libre Baskerville fonts downloaded in the project
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement theme provider using Context API + localStorage for light/dark mode persistence
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure theme styling is applied consistently across all applications in the monorepo
- **FR-006**: System MUST support pnpm package management with proper workspace configuration
- **FR-007**: System MUST configure theme in packages/ui with symlinks to all apps for shared configuration
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain compatibility with existing shadcn components while applying new theme styling
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure theme meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards for aesthetic clinic compliance
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide working light/dark mode toggle functionality across all apps

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Theme Configuration**: Represents the styling settings, CSS variables, and font configurations installed in shared packages
- **Component Registry**: Manages reusable theme components and their styling across applications in packages/ui
- **Monorepo Structure**: Theme installed in packages directory for consumption by all apps (web, api, etc.)
