# Feature Specification: Enhanced Multi-Model AI Assistant (CRUD & Analytics Expansion)

**Feature Branch**: `[003-enhanced-multi-model]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Enhanced multi-model AI assistant with plan gating, natural language CRUD (Clients Finance Agenda), cross-domain analytics, quota and abuse limits"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse description → identify multi-model, plan gating, CRUD, cross-domain analytics, quota, abuse prevention
2. Extract actors (free user, premium user, admin), actions (query, analyze, CRUD modify), data domains (Clients, Finance, Agenda)
3. Mark & resolve ambiguities (model catalog labels, quotas, abuse thresholds, historical window, recommendation scope)
4. Define user & edge scenarios
5. Generate functional requirements (FR-EN-###) testable & business-focused
6. Identify entities (Plan, Usage Counter, Recommendation, etc.)
7. Run checklist for business focus (no implementation details)
8. Output finalized draft for planning
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A premium clinic administrator asks one natural language question combining client engagement trends, appointment cancellations, and overdue invoices to receive a unified summary and actionable recommendations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a free user requests a premium analytical feature, **When** executed, **Then** system displays upgrade prompt and declines restricted action.
2. **Given** a premium user issues “update the appointment tomorrow 10am to 2pm for patient X”, **When** validated, **Then** the system confirms the updated schedule.
3. **Given** a premium user asks “Which clients overdue on payments also missed an appointment last month?”, **When** processed, **Then** unified cross-domain results are returned without unnecessary personal identifiers.
4. **Given** a free user exceeds quota (≥40 read queries in one day), **When** further queries submitted, **Then** system declines with usage summary and prompts upgrade.
5. **Given** a model becomes unavailable mid-response, **When** failover occurs, **Then** user sees neutral notice: "Your answer was completed using an alternate processing tier." 

### Edge Cases
- Delete request by free plan user → upgrade prompt refusal.
- Ambiguous CRUD target → clarification before any modification.
- Disallowed sensitive aggregation request → compliance refusal.
- Abuse threshold triggered (>12 queries in 60s OR >5 modifies/10m) → 15m cool-down notice.
- Partial multi-step CRUD (some successes) → partial outcome report + next steps.
- Time-zone ambiguity → system requests explicit timezone (falls back to clinic TZ else UTC).
- Complex instruction implying >5 entity modifications → confirmation required before execution.
- Cancellation by user after 2s processing → system stops and summarizes incomplete state.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-EN-001**: System MUST provide model access: free = MODEL_BASIC; premium = MODEL_ADV_REASON, MODEL_SPEED, MODEL_ANALYTICS.
- **FR-EN-002**: System MUST enforce plan gating: modifying CRUD only for premium; read queries for all (within permissions).
- **FR-EN-003**: System MUST support CRUD verbs create/read/update/delete across Clients, Finance, Agenda (delete uses soft-delete where required).
- **FR-EN-004**: System MUST confirm each successful modification with a human-readable summary.
- **FR-EN-005**: System MUST request clarification for ambiguous CRUD targets before acting.
- **FR-EN-006**: System MUST produce cross-domain analytical summaries combining multiple domains when authorized.
- **FR-EN-007**: System MUST exclude unnecessary personal identifiers in analytics (aggregate only).
- **FR-EN-008**: System MUST show upgrade prompt on premium-only action attempts by free users.
- **FR-EN-009**: System MUST track daily usage: free (40 read/day; 0 modify), premium (no fixed limit; still abuse thresholds) and enforce.
- **FR-EN-010**: System MUST display remaining free quota when usage reaches 80% and at exhaustion.
- **FR-EN-011**: System MUST provide partial outcome report when multi-step CRUD partially succeeds.
- **FR-EN-012**: System MUST audit every CRUD action (actor, action type, timestampUTC, outcome) retained 5 years (>=2 years configurable minimal).
- **FR-EN-013**: System MUST indicate neutral failover message when fallback completes a response.
- **FR-EN-014**: System SHOULD show processing duration (target p95 <=5s cross-domain, <=3s single-domain CRUD).
- **FR-EN-015**: System MUST block destructive deletes on locked/finalized or regulatory-hold records.
- **FR-EN-016**: System MUST refuse operations lacking required consent.
- **FR-EN-017**: System MUST allow premium historical analytics up to 12 months.
- **FR-EN-018**: System MUST request clarification on ambiguous date/time; default clinic TZ else UTC.
- **FR-EN-019**: System MUST generate recommendations limited to payment follow-up, scheduling optimization, client engagement outreach.
- **FR-EN-020**: System MUST enforce abuse thresholds (>12 queries/60s OR >5 modifies/10m) → 15m cool-down.
- **FR-EN-021**: System MUST support localization for pt-BR, en-US, es-ES (Phase 2 adds es-ES).
- **FR-EN-022**: System MUST distinguish read vs modifying requests and refuse modifications for unauthorized roles/plans.
- **FR-EN-023**: System MUST aggregate cross-domain metrics without raw record identifiers.
- **FR-EN-024**: System MUST provide compliance-framed error/refusal reasons (non-technical wording).
- **FR-EN-025**: System SHOULD present dynamic upgrade benefit phrasing from maintained marketing copy library.
- **FR-EN-026**: System MUST require confirmation if instruction implies >5 entity modifications or >3 domains.
- **FR-EN-027**: System MUST allow user cancellation after 2s via visible control.
- **FR-EN-028**: System MUST exclude internal sensitive IDs from confirmation messages.
- **FR-EN-029**: System MUST emit metrics taxonomy: queries.total/read/modify, upgrades.prompt_shown/clicked, failovers.count, refusals.consent/permissions, latency.p95, usage.approaching_limit.
- **FR-EN-030**: System MUST process domain onboarding via descriptor (name, operations, sensitivity classification) approved within 2 business days.

### Key Entities
- **Plan**: Defines entitlements (model tiers, CRUD scope, quotas).
- **Usage Counter**: Per-user daily counts & abuse windows.
- **Domain Object**: Abstract business entities (Client, Finance Record, Appointment).
- **Cross-Domain Query**: Combined multi-domain analytical request.
- **Recommendation**: Limited actionable follow-up guidance category.
- **Upgrade Prompt**: Contextual conversion surface.
- **Failover Notice**: Neutral fallback completion message.
- **Operation Confirmation**: Post-modification summary.
- **Partial Outcome Report**: Mixed success/failure details.
