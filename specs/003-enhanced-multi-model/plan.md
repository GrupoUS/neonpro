# Implementation Plan: Enhanced Multi-Model AI Assistant

**Branch**: `003-enhanced-multi-model` | **Date**: 2025-09-15 | **Spec**: ./spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-enhanced-multi-model/spec.md`

## Summary
Extend Phase 1 contextual Q&A to add plan gating, natural language CRUD across Clients/Finance/Agenda domains, cross-domain analytics + unified recommendations, usage quotas, abuse throttling, failover between model tiers, and expanded localization (es-ES Phase 2) while preserving privacy and compliance constraints.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x  
**Primary Dependencies**: Prior Phase 1 stack + additional model routing abstraction (multi provider), OpenAI + (future) Anthropic/Groq (placeholder), Zod, Supabase, React, Hono  
**Storage**: Supabase (add plan, usage, CRUD audit, recommendation artifacts)  
**Testing**: Add contract tests for new endpoints, quota + abuse integration tests, failover simulation tests, recommendation generation unit tests  
**Target Platform**: Web (frontend + backend)  
**Project Type**: web  
**Performance Goals**: p95 analytics summary <=5s, single-domain CRUD <=3s, failover overhead <400ms, rate-limiter decision <5ms  
**Constraints**: LGPD, quota enforcement accuracy >=99%, abuse cooldown 15m strict, historical analytics window 12m premium only  
**Scale/Scope**: 1k daily analytical queries initial, scaling to 10k.

## Constitution Check (Initial)
Simplicity: Reuse existing modules; add minimal routing layer not generic beyond current need. No new top-level project. PASS.
Architecture: Model routing as pure function with strategy map; CRUD service methods co-located in domain service directories. PASS.
Testing: Will add failover test before implementing fallback; enforce counters + abuse scenarios tests first. PASS.
Observability: Add metrics taxonomy (prom-style counters) + structured logs. PASS.
Versioning: Minor bump on release. PASS.

## Phase 0: Research Outline
Unknowns: Multi-model selection criteria (latency vs capability), recommendation template boundaries, quota calculation race conditions, partial CRUD transactional strategy, safe natural language → structured CRUD parser approach, abuse detection sliding window details.
Resolved in `research.md`.

## Phase 1: Design Highlights
Entities: Plan, UsageCounter, DomainObject, CrossDomainQuery, Recommendation, UpgradePrompt, FailoverNotice, OperationConfirmation, PartialOutcomeReport.
Contracts (proposed):
- POST /api/v1/ai/analyze (cross-domain analytics)
- POST /api/v1/ai/crud (natural language CRUD parse & execute)
- GET /api/v1/ai/usage (quota + remaining)
- POST /api/v1/ai/recommendations (generate limited categories)
- POST /api/v1/ai/cancel (cancellable operations)
- GET /api/v1/ai/models (model catalog visibility)

Data Model additions: plans, user_plan (association), usage_counters, recommendations, operation_logs (extend audit_events or specialized view), domain_descriptors table for onboarding.
Quickstart includes upgrade flow, analytics query, CRUD modify, quota exhaustion, abuse trigger, failover simulation.
Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach (Description Only)
Parallel groups: contract schema tests per endpoint, parser unit tests, quota window tests, failover strategy tests. Sequential: migrations → types → quota + abuse logic → CRUD parser → services → endpoints → UI components → recommendations engine → failover integration → metrics instrumentation.
