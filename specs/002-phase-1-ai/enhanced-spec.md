  - Segurança do paciente (patient safety)

## Enhanced User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary Enhanced User Story
A licensed aesthetic professional wants precise, LGPD-compliant answers about patient treatments, financial status, or procedural guidance through natural language queries, with full audit compliance and Brazilian healthcare terminology support.

### Enhanced Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: LGPD-Compliant Treatment Query
**Given** aesthetic professional has valid CFM/CRP registration AND patient has current consent for AI-assisted consultation  
**When** they ask "Quais foram os últimos tratamentos da paciente Maria?" (What were Maria's recent treatments?)  
**When** processed through AI system with PII redaction  
**Then** system returns treatment summary in Portuguese with aesthetic terminology AND logs LGPD-compliant audit event AND maintains <2s response time

#### Scenario 2: ANVISA Equipment Compliance Check  
**Given** professional queries about aesthetic equipment usage  
**When** they ask "Este equipamento de laser está aprovado pela ANVISA?" (Is this laser equipment ANVISA approved?)  
**Then** system validates equipment registration status AND returns compliance information AND logs regulatory query

#### Scenario 3: Constitutional Performance Requirement
**Given** clinic operations during peak hours  
**When** multiple simultaneous AI queries are submitted  
**Then** each response maintains <2s constitutional requirement AND uses failover provider if needed AND preserves conversation context

### Enhanced Edge Cases

#### LGPD-Specific Edge Cases
- **Missing or expired consent** → Detailed refusal with consent renewal guidance in Portuguese
- **Data subject access request** → AI explains data usage with right to explanation compliance
- **Cross-clinic data query** → RLS enforcement with clear clinic boundary explanation
- **Minor patient data** → Enhanced protection with guardian consent validation

#### ANVISA Compliance Edge Cases
- **Unregistered equipment query** → Safety warning with ANVISA registration requirement
- **Off-label aesthetic use** → Professional scope compliance check with CFM/CRP validation
- **Equipment maintenance query** → Regulatory maintenance requirement guidance

#### Performance & Reliability Edge Cases
- **Primary AI provider failure** → Seamless failover to secondary provider within 500ms
- **Portuguese language processing errors** → Fallback to standardized medical terminology
- **Real-time subscription failures** → Graceful degradation with polling backup
