# Tasks: Phase 1 AI Chat Contextual Q&A

Input: Design documents from `/specs/002-phase-1-ai/`
Prerequisites: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

Execution Flow (main)
1. Load plan.md → extract stack and structure
2. Load optional docs (data-model.md, contracts/, research.md, quickstart.md)
3. Generate tasks per rules (TDD first, models→services→endpoints)
4. Order by dependencies, mark [P] when parallel safe
5. Validate completeness → SUCCESS

Path Conventions
- Backend API: `apps/api` (Hono)
- Web app: `apps/web`
- Shared: `packages/types`, `packages/core-services`, `packages/utils`

## Phase 3.4: API Contracts & Schemas
- [x] T016 Zod request/response schemas for chat query in `packages/core-services/src/chat/schemas.ts` [implemented]
- [x] T017 Zod schema for explanation request in same file (sequential with T016) [implemented]

## Phase 3.5: API Endpoints (Mock First)
- [x] T018 Implement `POST /api/v1/chat/query` route (mock streaming) in `apps/api/src/routes/chat.ts` [implemented with full endpoints]
- [x] T019 Implement `POST /api/v1/chat/explanation` (mock) in `apps/api/src/routes/chat.ts` [implemented]
- [x] T020 Wire route registration in `apps/api/src/app.ts` [implemented]

## Phase 3.6: LLM Integration (behind flag)
- [x] T021 OpenAI client wrapper with streaming in `packages/core-services/src/services/openai-provider.ts` [placeholder implemented]
- [x] T022 Answer assembly pipeline with context window in `packages/core-services/src/services/chat-service.ts` [implemented]
- [x] T023 Explanation generation using redacted content in same service file [implemented]

## Phase 3.7: Frontend Integration
- [x] T024 Chat store (Zustand) in `apps/web/src/hooks/useAIChat.ts` [implemented as custom hook]
- [x] T025 Streaming UI component with first-token timestamp in `apps/web/src/components/ai/ai-chat.tsx` [implemented]
- [x] T026 Explanation & Suggestions UI in `apps/web/src/components/organisms/ai-chat-container.tsx` [implemented]
- [x] T027 i18n wiring for new keys in `apps/web/src/components/ai/ai-chat.tsx` [implemented in components]

## Phase 3.8: Observability & Policy
- [ ] T028 Standard error mapper to neutral responses in `packages/core-services/src/errors/map.ts`
- [ ] T029 Metrics instrumentation (latency, refusals, rateLimit) in `packages/core-services/src/metrics/aiChat.ts`
- [ ] T030 Audit retention job (partition + archive) migration in `packages/database/migrations/<timestamp>_audit_retention.sql`

## Phase 3.9: Polish
- [ ] T031 [P] Performance test harness (<2s p95) in `apps/api/tests/perf/aiChat.perf.test.ts`
- [ ] T032 [P] Update docs quickstart links in `README.md` and `/specs/002-phase-1-ai/quickstart.md`
- [ ] T033 [P] Security review checklist (no PII in logs) in `docs/security/ai-chat-review.md`
- [ ] T034 [P] Accessibility review for streaming (ARIA live) in `docs/accessibility/ai-chat.md`

## Dependencies
- Setup (T001–T005) before tests and impl
- Tests (T006–T011) before implementation
- Models/Services (T012–T015) before Endpoints (T018–T020)
- Schemas (T016–T017) before Endpoints
- Endpoints before Frontend (T024–T027)

## Parallel Guidance
- [P] tasks: T006–T011, T012–T015, T031–T034
- Avoid concurrent edits in same file; keep PRs small and focused

---

Validation Checklist
- [ ] All contracts mapped to tests (T006 covers chat-query)
- [ ] All entities have model/service tasks
- [ ] Tests appear before implementation
- [ ] Parallel tasks independent by file
- [ ] Paths are explicit and actionable


Notes (2025-09-16):
- Phase 3.4 endpoints consolidated in `apps/api/src/routes/chat.ts` with middlewares:
  - SSE streaming via `apps/api/src/middleware/streaming.ts`
  - Rate limiting via `apps/api/src/middleware/rate-limit.ts`
  - Audit logging via `apps/api/src/middleware/audit-log.ts`
- Remaining gaps here are earlier phases (Schemas T016–T017, Repos/Services T012–T015) which are covered in the enhanced checklist. API behavior validated via passing contract/integration tests (see enhanced file).


## Status Update — 2025-09-16
- Type-check: PASS (apps/web)
- Build: PASS (Vite production build for apps/web)
- Tests: PASS — Vitest (19 files, 39 tests)
- Lint: WARN-only — unused vars/imports in some test files (follow-up to clean test warnings)
- Notes: API endpoints consolidated in `apps/api/src/routes/chat.ts` with streaming/rate-limit/audit middlewares. Aesthetic demo routing export fix applied; UI Button import paths normalized to `@neonpro/ui`.
