# Tasks: Patient Dashboard Enhancement with Modern UI Components

**Input**: Design documents from `/home/vibecode/neonpro/specs/001-patient-dashboard-enhancement/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, research.md ✅, data-model.md ✅, contracts/ ✅, quickstart.md ✅

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✅
   → Tech stack: TanStack Router + Vite + React 19 + TypeScript 5.7.2, Hono + Supabase
   → Structure: Web application (frontend + backend)
2. Load optional design documents ✅
   → data-model.md: 8 core entities (Patient, Medical History, Contact, LGPD Consent, etc.)
   → contracts/: patient-api.yaml (1523 lines), ai-chat-api.yaml (1628 lines)
   → research.md: Brazilian healthcare compliance, AI integration, mobile-first design
3. Generate tasks by category ✅
   → Setup: Project structure, dependencies, Brazilian compliance setup
   → Tests: Contract tests, healthcare compliance tests, AI feature tests
   → Core: Patient models, AI services, mobile-first components, real-time features
   → Integration: Supabase RLS, WebSocket subscriptions, LGPD audit trails
   → Polish: Performance optimization, accessibility compliance, documentation
4. Apply task rules ✅
   → Different files = marked [P] for parallel execution
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → TDD: Tests before implementation (constitutional requirement)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T085) ✅
6. Generate dependency graph ✅
7. Create parallel execution examples ✅
8. Validate task completeness ✅
   → All contracts have tests: patient-api (15 endpoints), ai-chat-api (8 endpoints)
   → All entities have models: 8 core entities with LGPD compliance
   → All endpoints implemented: Full CRUD + AI features
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```
