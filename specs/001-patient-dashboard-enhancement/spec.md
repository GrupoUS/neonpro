## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Healthcare staff and clinic administrators need a modernized, efficient patient management interface that reduces data entry time by 50%, ensures regulatory compliance, and provides mobile accessibility for point-of-care scenarios. The enhanced dashboard must streamline patient registration, improve data accuracy through intelligent validation, and support bulk operations for administrative efficiency.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Patient Registration Flow
1. **Given** a healthcare staff member needs to register a new patient, **When** they access the patient registration interface, **Then** they see a guided multi-step form with Brazilian-specific fields (CPF, phone, address) and real-time validation
2. **Given** incomplete or invalid patient information is entered, **When** the user attempts to proceed, **Then** the system displays clear, specific error messages in Portuguese and prevents form submission until corrected
3. **Given** a patient consents to data processing, **When** they complete the LGPD consent section, **Then** the system records consent details with timestamp, IP address, and consent version for audit compliance

#### Patient Data Management
4. **Given** a clinic administrator searches for existing patients, **When** they use the enhanced search interface, **Then** they can filter by name, CPF, phone, registration date, and status with results appearing in under 300ms
5. **Given** multiple patients need status updates, **When** the administrator selects patients and chooses bulk actions, **Then** the system processes all changes atomically and provides immediate feedback
6. **Given** a patient's information needs updating, **When** staff accesses the patient record, **Then** they see all relevant data organized clearly with edit capabilities restricted by user permissions

#### Mobile Access & Navigation
7. **Given** healthcare staff access the dashboard on mobile devices, **When** they navigate patient information, **Then** all functionality remains fully accessible with touch-optimized interface and responsive design
8. **Given** users navigate between different patient contexts, **When** they use the navigation system, **Then** breadcrumbs clearly show their location and sidebar state persists across sessions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a patient's CPF fails validation during registration? System displays specific error message and suggests correction format
- How does system handle patient data access by unauthorized staff? Access is denied with audit log entry and user notification
- What occurs when bulk operations affect patients currently being edited by other users? System prevents conflicts through optimistic locking and user notification
- How does the interface behave with patients who have extensive medical histories? Data is paginated and lazy-loaded to maintain performance
- What happens when mobile users lose internet connectivity during form completion? System preserves entered data locally and syncs when connection resumes

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Data Management & Forms
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide multi-step patient registration forms with Brazilian-specific validation (CPF format, phone number format, CEP address lookup)
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate all patient data in real-time during form entry and display immediate feedback for invalid entries
- **FR-003**: System MUST support file upload for patient documents (medical records, identification, insurance cards) with format validation
- **FR-004**: System MUST auto-save form progress and allow recovery after browser refresh or connection interruption

#### Search & Data Display
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide advanced patient search with filtering by name, CPF, phone number, registration date, and patient status
- **FR-006**: System MUST display patient data in sortable, filterable tables that load efficiently with 1000+ patient records
- **FR-007**: System MUST support bulk selection and operations (status updates, data export, batch communications) with confirmation dialogs
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide data export functionality in standard formats (CSV, PDF) for reporting and compliance needs

#### Navigation & User Experience
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide collapsible sidebar navigation with persistent state across user sessions
- **FR-010**: System MUST display context-aware breadcrumb navigation showing current patient and section location
- **FR-011**: System MUST offer global search functionality accessible through command palette or quick search interface
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide mobile-responsive design that maintains full functionality on devices with 320px+ screen width

#### Compliance & Security
- **FR-013**: System MUST implement LGPD-compliant consent management with multi-level consent options (data processing, marketing, sharing)
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain audit trail for all patient data access, modifications, and exports with user identification and timestamps
- **FR-015**: System MUST ensure WCAG 2.1 AA+ accessibility compliance including keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and proper contrast ratios

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

#### Patient Record
- **Patient**: Core entity representing individuals receiving healthcare services. Contains personal identification (CPF, RG, full name, preferred name), contact information (email, phone, address), medical information (birth date, gender, medical history, allergies, medications), healthcare provider data (insurance, emergency contact), and compliance data (LGPD consent records with audit trail)

#### Medical Information
- **Medical History**: Historical medical data associated with patients including previous treatments, conditions, procedures, and outcomes. Links to patient records and maintains temporal sequencing for treatment planning

#### Contact & Communication
- **Contact Information**: Structured data for patient communication including Brazilian-formatted phone numbers, email addresses, and physical addresses with CEP validation. Supports multiple contact methods per patient with preference indicators

#### Compliance & Audit
- **LGPD Consent**: Legal consent records tracking patient permissions for data processing, marketing communications, and third-party sharing. Includes consent timestamps, IP addresses, consent form versions, and withdrawal records for regulatory compliance
