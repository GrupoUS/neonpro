# Patient Dashboard Enhancement - Quick Start Guide

## Overview

This guide provides essential testing scenarios and validation steps for the Patient Dashboard Enhancement feature, focusing on the modernized interface with MCP pattern, shadcn/ui components, and Brazilian healthcare compliance.

## Prerequisites

### Environment Setup
- Node.js 20+ with Bun package manager
- TypeScript 5.7.2+ configuration
- React 19.1.1 development environment
- shadcn/ui with experiment-01.json registry configured
- Supabase development instance with Brazilian healthcare schema

### Required Dependencies
```bash
# Core dependencies
bun add @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-table @tanstack/react-router
bun add zustand react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers
bun add zod date-fns lucide-react

# Development dependencies  
bun add -D @types/react @types/node typescript vitest
```

## Quick Start Testing Scenarios

### 1. Patient Registration Flow (Core)

**Scenario**: New patient registration with Brazilian-specific validation
```gherkin
Given a healthcare professional is on the patient registration page
When they fill in patient details with valid CPF "123.456.789-00"
And provide phone number in format "+55 (11) 99999-9999"
And enter CEP "01310-100" for address autocomplete
Then the system should validate all Brazilian-specific formats
And save the patient record with LGPD consent tracking
And display success confirmation with patient ID
```

**Key Validations**:
- CPF format and checksum validation
- Brazilian phone number format (+55 format)
- CEP format and address autocomplete
- LGPD consent capture and tracking
- Form accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA+)

### 2. Advanced Data Grid Operations

**Scenario**: Patient list with filtering and bulk operations
```gherkin
Given the healthcare professional is viewing the patient list
When they apply filters for "age range 25-65" and "city São Paulo"
And select 5 patients from the filtered results
Then the bulk operations menu should appear
And they can export selected patients to PDF/CSV
And perform bulk status updates with audit logging
```

**Key Features**:
- TanStack Table with server-side filtering
- Multi-select with bulk operations
- Export functionality (PDF/CSV/Excel)
- Real-time data updates
- Performance optimization (virtual scrolling)

### 3. Mobile Responsiveness

**Scenario**: Mobile access and touch interactions
```gherkin
Given a user accesses the dashboard on mobile device (375px width)
When they navigate through patient records
Then all interactions should be touch-optimized
And navigation should use mobile-first patterns
And data tables should be horizontally scrollable
And forms should adapt to vertical layout
```

**Mobile Requirements**:
- Responsive breakpoints: 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px
- Touch-friendly targets (44px minimum)
- Swipe gestures for navigation
- Offline-capable forms with sync

### 4. Performance Validation

**Scenario**: Large dataset handling and performance
```gherkin
Given the system has 10,000+ patient records
When a user searches for patients
Then initial load should complete within 2 seconds
And search results should appear within 500ms
And pagination should handle 50-100 records per page
And memory usage should remain under 100MB
```

**Performance Targets**:
- Initial load: ≤2s (including data)
- Search response: ≤500ms
- Form interactions: ≤100ms
- Memory usage: ≤100MB browser
- Bundle size: ≤500KB gzipped

### 5. LGPD Compliance Testing

**Scenario**: Data privacy and consent management
```gherkin
Given a patient record exists with personal data
When a data subject requests data export
Then the system should generate complete data report
And include all consent history and processing activities
And provide secure download with access logging
And allow data deletion with proper audit trail
```

**Compliance Checks**:
- Consent tracking and history
- Data export (portability)
- Data deletion (right to be forgotten)
- Access logging and audit trails
- Purpose limitation validation

## Testing Commands

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run component tests
bun test src/components/patients/

# Test Brazilian validators
bun test src/lib/validators/brazilian.test.ts

# Test LGPD compliance functions
bun test src/lib/compliance/lgpd.test.ts
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Test API integration
bun test:integration src/api/patients/

# Test form workflows
bun test:e2e src/workflows/patient-registration.spec.ts

# Test mobile responsiveness
bun test:visual src/components/patients/ --mobile
```

### Performance Tests
```bash
# Load testing
bun test:load src/pages/patients/

# Bundle analysis
bun run build:analyze

# Accessibility audit
bun test:a11y src/components/patients/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**shadcn/ui Components Not Loading**
```bash
# Verify registry configuration
cat components.json
# Should reference experiment-01.json registry

# Reinstall components
bunx shadcn@latest add button form table
```

**Brazilian Validation Failures**
```bash
# Check CPF validator
bun test src/lib/validators/cpf.test.ts

# Verify phone number format
bun test src/lib/validators/phone.test.ts

# Test CEP integration
bun test src/lib/validators/cep.test.ts
```

**Performance Issues**
```bash
# Analyze bundle size
bun run build:analyze

# Check memory leaks
bun test:memory src/components/patients/

# Profile React components
bun run dev:profile
```

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 2**: Execute task generation using plan template
2. **Implementation**: Begin with failing tests (TDD approach)
3. **Integration**: Set up continuous testing pipeline
4. **Deployment**: Configure staging environment
5. **Monitoring**: Implement performance and compliance monitoring
