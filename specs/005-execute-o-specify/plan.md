**Date**: 2025-09-29  
**Spec**: `/specs/005-execute-o-specify/spec.md`  
**Input**: Hybrid architecture implementation based on comprehensive research

## Execution Flow

**✅ COMPLETED**:
1. **Load feature spec** → `spec.md` loaded successfully
2. **Fill Technical Context** → Resolved via comprehensive research
3. **Constitution Check** → Validated against constitutional requirements
4. **Execute Phase 0** → Research complete (A- grade, 9.2/10 validation)
5. **Execute Phase 1** → Design deliverables complete
6. **Execute Phase 2** → Task generation complete (60 detailed tasks)

## Summary

**Primary Goal**: Migrate NeonPro healthcare platform from Node.js/pnpm to Bun + hybrid architecture (Vercel Edge + Supabase Functions) while maintaining healthcare compliance (LGPD, ANVISA, CFM) and improving performance.

**Key Findings**: 
- Current architecture is production-ready (A- grade, 9.2/10)
- Hybrid Edge/Node split already implemented
- All healthcare compliance requirements built-in
- Performance targets currently met with optimization potential
- **Recommendation**: Optimize existing architecture vs. major restructuring

**Primary Dependencies**: TanStack Router, tRPC v11, Supabase, shadcn/ui ✅  
**Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL + RLS ✅  
**Testing**: Vitest + Playwright (90%+ coverage) ✅  
**Target Platform**: Vercel Edge + Supabase Functions ✅  
**Project Type**: Web application (healthcare platform) ✅  
**Performance Goals**: Edge TTFB ≤ 150ms, Realtime ≤ 1.5s ✅  
**Constraints**: Healthcare compliance, type safety, performance SLOs ✅  
**Scale/Scope**: 454-line PRD, multi-specialty aesthetic clinics ✅

```

**Structure Decision**: Maintain current structure (Option 1) - optimization focus vs. restructuring

## Phase 0: Research & Analysis ✅ COMPLETE

**Research Completed**: Comprehensive analysis by apex-researcher + apex-architect-review agents
**Key Findings**:
- Architecture Validation: A- grade (9.2/10) - Production Ready
- Performance Targets: All currently met with 3-5x improvement potential
- Healthcare Compliance: LGPD, ANVISA, CFM built-in and compliant
- Migration Feasibility: High compatibility with low risk
- **Recommendation**: Optimize existing architecture vs. major restructuring

**Output**: `research.md` with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts ✅ COMPLETE

**Design Deliverables**:
1. **Data Model** (`data-model.md`): Complete entity definitions and relationships
2. **Quickstart Guide** (`quickstart.md`): Implementation guide with step-by-step instructions
3. **API Contracts** (`contracts/api-contracts.yaml`): OpenAPI 3.0 specification
4. **Agent Context** (`CLAUDE.md`): Updated with hybrid architecture status

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Maintain current hybrid architecture (Edge reads + Node writes)
- Focus on Bun migration for performance optimization
- Expand Edge functionality for read operations
- Enhance security and compliance measures
- Implement comprehensive monitoring

**Output**: Complete design documentation ready for implementation

## Phase 2: Task Planning ✅ COMPLETE

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models → Services → UI
- 60 detailed implementation tasks across 4 phases
- Parallel execution opportunities identified
- Quality gates and success criteria defined

**Task Structure**:
- **Phase 1**: Bun Migration (Week 1-2) - 18 tasks
- **Phase 2**: Edge Expansion (Week 3-4) - 18 tasks  
- **Phase 3**: Security Enhancement (Week 5-6) - 12 tasks
