# Tasks: NeonPro Architecture & Testing Optimization

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-execute-o-specify/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, research.md ✅, data-model.md ✅, contracts/api-contracts.yaml ✅, quickstart.md ✅

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✅
   → Extract: Hybrid architecture (Vercel Edge + Supabase Functions), Bun migration, 4 phases
2. Load optional design documents: ✅
   → data-model.md: 8 core entities → model tasks
   → contracts/api-contracts.yaml: 8 API endpoints → contract test tasks
   → research.md: A- grade validation, optimization focus
   → quickstart.md: 4-phase implementation plan
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Bun migration, Edge configuration
   → Tests: API contract tests, migration tests
   → Core: Architecture models, migration services
   → Integration: Database, performance, compliance
   → Polish: Monitoring, documentation, validation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness: ✅
   → All contracts have tests ✅
   → All entities have models ✅
   → All endpoints implemented ✅
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution) ✅
