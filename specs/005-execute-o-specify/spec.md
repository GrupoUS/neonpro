# Feature Specification: Execute Architecture Planning

**Feature Branch**: `005-execute-o-specify`  
**Created**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "execute o specify com base no que j√° foi planejado"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **NeonPro Aesthetic Clinic Compliance**: Consider these mandatory requirements:
   - Brazilian aesthetic clinic regulations (LGPD, ANVISA, relevant professional councils)
   - Client data protection and privacy for aesthetic procedures
   - AI-powered prevention capabilities for no-show reduction
   - Mobile-first Brazilian experience for all aesthetic professionals
   - Type safety and data integrity for clinic operations
5. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions (clinic owners, aesthetic professionals, coordinators)
   - Data retention/deletion policies for client information
   - Performance targets and scale for aesthetic clinic workflows
   - Error handling behaviors specific to aesthetic procedures
   - Integration requirements for aesthetic clinic management
   - Security/compliance needs for cosmetic products and equipment
   - Aesthetic clinic compliance requirements

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system architect, I want to execute the architecture specification process based on the previously planned hybrid architecture (Bun + Edge + Supabase Functions), so that I can transform the current Node.js-based NeonPro platform into a zero-Node.js-runtime production environment while maintaining all healthcare compliance requirements.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the architecture research and planning has been completed, **When** I execute the specification process, **Then** a comprehensive specification document is created that captures all architectural decisions and migration requirements
2. **Given** stakeholders need to understand the migration impact, **When** the specification is complete, **Then** it clearly outlines the benefits, risks, and timeline for the hybrid architecture transition
3. **Given** healthcare compliance requirements, **When** the specification is reviewed, **Then** it demonstrates that all LGPD, ANVISA, and CFM requirements will be maintained during the migration

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the architecture specification reveals incompatibilities with current healthcare compliance requirements?
- How does the system handle potential performance regressions during the migration process?
- What is the rollback strategy if the new architecture doesn't meet performance expectations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST create a comprehensive specification document based on the previously researched hybrid architecture (Bun + Edge + Supabase Functions)
- **FR-002**: Specification MUST clearly define the migration path from current Node.js-based architecture to zero-Node.js-runtime production environment
- **FR-003**: System MUST document how healthcare compliance (LGPD, ANVISA, CFM) will be maintained throughout the migration
- **FR-004**: System MUST outline the benefits and performance improvements expected from the hybrid architecture
- **FR-005**: System MUST identify all risk factors and mitigation strategies for the migration
- **FR-006**: Specification MUST include a detailed rollout plan with phases and timeline
- **FR-007**: System MUST define success criteria for determining when the migration is complete
- **FR-008**: Specification MUST include monitoring and observability requirements for the new architecture

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Architecture Specification**: Document containing all architectural decisions, migration plans, and compliance considerations
- **Migration Plan**: Step-by-step guide for transitioning from current architecture to hybrid architecture
- **Compliance Matrix**: Mapping of current compliance requirements to new architecture implementation
- **Risk Assessment**: Document identifying potential risks and mitigation strategies
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Current vs. expected performance metrics comparison
