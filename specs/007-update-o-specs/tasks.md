# Tasks: AI Agent Database Integration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/007-update-o-specs/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)

1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)

- **Tests** (T009-T021) must be written and failing before any implementation
- **Data Types** (T022-T027) must complete before services and endpoints
- **Core Services** (T028-T034) must complete before API endpoints (T035-T037)
- **API Endpoints** (T035-T037) must complete before frontend integration
- **HTTPS Security** (T043-T048) must complete before production deployment

### Phase Dependencies
- Phase 2 (Tests) → Phase 3 (Implementation)
- Phase 3.1 (Types) → Phase 3.2 (Services) → Phase 3.3 (Endpoints) → Phase 3.4 (Frontend)
- Phase 4.1 (Security) must be parallel with Phase 4.2 (Agent Integration)
- Phase 5 (Performance) requires Phase 3 and 4 completion

### Blocking Relationships
- T028 (AIDataService base) blocks T029-T031 (data methods)
- T032 (intent parser service) blocks T033-T034 (classification logic)
- T035-T037 (endpoints) block T053-T054 (frontend integration)
- T049-T052 (agent setup) blocks T053-T054 (frontend connection)

## Task Generation Rules

_Applied during main() execution_

1. **From Contracts**: 3 API endpoints → 3 contract test tasks [P]
2. **From Data Model**: 6 core entities → 6 interface/type tasks [P]
3. **From User Stories**: 5 acceptance scenarios → 5 integration test tasks [P]
4. **From Tech Stack**: CopilotKit + AG-UI + ottomator-agents → setup and integration tasks
5. **From Security Requirements**: HTTPS + TLS 1.3 + security headers → security implementation tasks

## Validation Checklist

_GATE: Checked by main() before returning_

- [x] All contracts have corresponding test tasks
- [x] All entities have interface/type tasks
- [x] All acceptance scenarios have integration tests
- [x] All tests come before implementation (TDD enforced)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] HTTPS security requirements fully covered
- [x] Performance requirements addressed
- [x] Dependencies clearly documented

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **Sequential tasks** = same file or direct dependencies
- **TDD enforced**: All tests must be written and failing before implementation
- **HTTPS mandatory**: All security tasks must pass before production deployment
- **Performance gates**: Response time and handshake performance must be validated
- Commit after each task completion for better tracking
