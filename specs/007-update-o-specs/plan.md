# Implementation Plan: AI Agent Database Integration

**Branch**: `007-update-o-specs` | **Date**: 2025-09-20 | **Spec**: [/specs/007-update-o-specs/spec.md](/specs/007-update-o-specs/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/007-update-o-specs/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Create a conversational AI interface for NeonPro that allows healthcare professionals to query client data, appointments, and financial information through natural language. The solution uses CopilotKit for the chat UI, AG-UI Protocol for real-time communication, and ottomator-agents as the backend logic base, with secure integration to Supabase database. All communication must use HTTPS with TLS 1.3+ and comprehensive security headers.## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+, Python 3.11+, Node.js 18+
**Primary Dependencies**: CopilotKit, AG-UI Protocol, ottomator-agents, Supabase
**Storage**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with RLS policies
**Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E testing
**Target Platform**: Web application (React/Next.js)
**Project Type**: web (frontend + backend)
**Performance Goals**: <2s response time for simple queries, HTTPS handshake ≤300ms, support concurrent users
**Constraints**: Must respect RLS policies, no exposure of service keys, HTTPS with TLS 1.3+ mandatory, real-time communication required
**Scale/Scope**: Multi-tenant healthcare application with role-based access control, conversational AI interface

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

   - ✅ Token efficiency maintained

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests specs, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md ✅

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base structure
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design documents (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each API endpoint → contract test task [P] (parallel execution)
- Each data entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story scenario → integration test task
- Implementation tasks organized to make tests pass (TDD approach)

**Ordering Strategy**:

- **TDD Principle**: All tests created before any implementation
- **Dependency Order**: Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration → Polish
- **Parallel Execution**: Mark [P] for tasks affecting different files
- **Security First**: HTTPS configuration and security headers in setup phase

**Task Categories to Generate**:

1. **Setup Phase** (T001-T010):
   - Install CopilotKit, AG-UI Protocol, ottomator-agents dependencies
   - Configure HTTPS with TLS 1.3 support
   - Implement security headers middleware
   - Set up automatic certificate renewal
   - Configure environment variables and secrets

2. **Testing Phase** (T011-T025):
   - Contract tests for all API endpoints [P]
   - Security header validation tests [P]
   - HTTPS enforcement tests [P]
   - Integration tests for data access [P]
   - Performance tests for response times [P]

3. **Core Implementation** (T026-T045):
   - Data models and interfaces [P]
   - Database service layer with RLS
   - Intent parser for natural language queries
   - Agent integration with ottomator-agents
   - API endpoints implementation
   - Session management system

4. **Frontend Integration** (T046-T055):
   - CopilotKit chat component integration
   - AG-UI Protocol communication layer
   - Custom hooks for agent interaction
   - Response formatting components
   - Interactive action handlers

5. **Security & Performance** (T056-T065):
   - Complete HTTPS security implementation
   - Security headers middleware deployment
   - Certificate monitoring and alerts
   - Performance optimization for <2s queries
   - Caching strategies for frequent data

6. **Polish & Validation** (T066-T075):
   - Unit tests for all services [P]
   - E2E tests for complete user flows
   - Performance validation and optimization
   - Documentation updates
   - Quickstart scenario validation

**Estimated Output**: 75+ numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md with clear dependencies

**Parallel Execution Examples**:

- Setup tasks (different config files) can run in parallel
- Contract tests (different endpoints) can run in parallel
- Data model tasks (different entities) can run in parallel
- Frontend components (different files) can run in parallel

**Dependencies to Enforce**:

- Setup tasks before all other phases
- All test tasks before implementation tasks
- Models before services before endpoints
- Core implementation before frontend integration
- Security configuration before production deployment

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_No constitutional violations detected - design follows constitutional principles_

- ✅ Using established frameworks (CopilotKit, AG-UI) rather than custom solutions
- ✅ Leveraging existing NeonPro infrastructure and patterns
- ✅ Following KISS principle with proven technology choices
- ✅ YAGNI compliance - building only specified conversational interface
- ✅ All HTTPS security requirements from constitution implemented
