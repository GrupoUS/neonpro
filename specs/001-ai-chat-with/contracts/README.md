# Contracts â€” AI Chat (Database-Aware)

This folder holds API contracts generated from functional requirements:
- Chat request/response
- Tool invocation inputs/outputs (e.g., finance summaries, clinical metrics)
- Explanation summary output (privacy-preserving)

Contracts are described in markdown for planning; implementation will produce formal OpenAPI/TS types in code.
