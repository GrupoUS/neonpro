# Feature Specification: AI Agent Database Integration

**Feature Branch**: `006-implemente-o-https`  
**Created**: 2025-09-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "implemente o https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit e https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui para aprimorar nossos agents do neonpro para interagir e ler totalmente os dados da nossa database, de clientes e financeiro e agendamentos usando o https://github.com/coleam00/ottomator-agents/tree/main/ag-ui-rag-agent para implementar no nosso projeto neonpro"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a healthcare professional, I want to conversationaly ask questions about my clients, appointments, and financial data through an AI chat interface, so I can quickly access and analyze information without navigating through multiple screens.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a logged-in user with appropriate permissions, **When** I ask "Quais os próximos agendamentos?", **Then** the system displays a list of upcoming appointments in the chat interface
2. **Given** I am a logged-in user with appropriate permissions, **When** I ask "Me mostre os clientes cadastrados", **Then** the system displays a list of all accessible clients in the chat interface
3. **Given** I am a logged-in user with appropriate permissions, **When** I ask "Como está o faturamento?", **Then** the system displays a financial summary in the chat interface
4. **Given** I ask about specific client data, **When** I provide a client name, **Then** the system retrieves and displays information specific to that client
5. **Given** I attempt to access data outside my permissions, **When** I make the request, **Then** the system responds with an appropriate access denied message

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user asks a question about data that doesn't exist? (e.g., appointments for a non-existent client)
- How does the system handle ambiguous queries where the intent is unclear?
- What happens when the database connection is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system handle requests for extremely large datasets?
- What happens when the user's session has expired during a conversation?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a conversational chat interface for users to interact with their data
- **FR-002**: System MUST understand and process natural language queries about clients, appointments, and financial data
- **FR-003**: System MUST enforce role-based access control on all data requests
- **FR-004**: System MUST display query results in an interactive, user-friendly format within the chat interface
- **FR-005**: System MUST support queries for appointment schedules, client information, and financial summaries
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle variations in how users phrase their questions (e.g., "próximos agendamentos" vs "agendamentos de hoje")
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide appropriate error messages for access denied, not found, and system errors
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain conversation context for follow-up questions
- **FR-009**: System MUST support interactive elements in responses (e.g., "Ver detalhes" buttons)
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure all database access respects Row Level Security (RLS) policies

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Query**: Natural language input from user requesting data or actions
- **AI Agent Response**: Structured response containing data, visualizations, and interactive elements
- **Client Data**: Personal and contact information of patients/clients
- **Appointment Data**: Scheduling information including dates, times, participants, and status
- **Financial Data**: Revenue, billing, and payment information
- **Permission Context**: User's access rights and data scope based on their role and domain

## Next Steps

This specification is ready for the implementation phase. The development team should proceed with:

1. **Phase 1: Infrastructure & POC**
   - Set up backend agent endpoint with mock responses
   - Implement basic chat UI connected to the agent
   - Verify end-to-end communication

2. **Phase 2: Database Integration**
   - Connect to Supabase with proper RLS enforcement
   - Implement real data retrieval for clients, appointments, and finances
   - Replace mock data with live database queries

3. **Phase 3: UX Enhancement**
   - Improve natural language understanding
   - Add rich response formatting and interactive elements
   - Implement proper error handling and user feedback
