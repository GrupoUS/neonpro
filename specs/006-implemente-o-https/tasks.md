## ‚úÖ QUALITY CHECKLIST

PRE:

- [ ] Explicit functional and non-functional requirements
- [ ] Security: No service keys in code, RLS enforced
- [ ] UI/UX and accessibility reviewed
      DURING:
- [ ] Each feature implemented as per testable acceptance criteria
- [ ] Agent responses correct, protected, friendly
- [ ] Real database reads validated end-to-end
      POST:
- [ ] ‚â•9.5/10 in UX feedback from user testing
- [ ] All critical workflows (list/query/summary) function as spec‚Äôd
- [ ] Integration points between CopilotKit, AG-UI, Backend, and DB are robust and observable

## üìÑ IMPLEMENTATION PLAN & PROMPT

### 1. ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

- **Frontend (apps/web)**:  
  Use CopilotKit for chat UI, context sync, agentic actions, and rendering rich database answers (lists, charts, details).
- **Protocol Layer**:  
  AG-UI for robust, event-driven, real-time agent/user communication.
- **Backend (apps/api)**:  
  Use ottomator-agents/ag-ui-rag-agent skeleton for agent logic, connecting safely to Supabase via new data service.

---

### 2. PHASED IMPLEMENTATION

#### **FASE 1: INFRA & POC**

**Backend**:

- Path: `apps/api/src/routes/ai/data-agent.ts`
- Install `ag-ui`, `pydantic` (or preferred agent infra)
- Create endpoint: `/api/ai/data-agent` using Hono.js
- Implement agent logic (mock returns for now):
  - Example queries:
    - "Quais os pr√≥ximos agendamentos?"
    - "Me mostre os clientes cadastrados"
    - "Como est√° o faturamento?"
- Expose via AG-UI protocol (`toAGUI`, etc.)

**Frontend**:

- Path: `apps/web/src/components/ai/DataAgentChat.tsx`
- Install `@copilotkit/react-core`, `@copilotkit/react-ui`
- Make new Chat component using CopilotKit
- Connect CopilotKitProvider to `/api/ai/data-agent`
- POC: Send queries, receive/display mock results

**Test Criteria**:

- User sees chat, types a question, gets a list/answer (even if mock) live in the UI

---

#### **FASE 2: DATABASE INTEGRATION**

**Backend**:

- Path: `apps/api/src/services/ai-data-service.ts`
- Build data service to safely read from Supabase
  - `getClientByName(name: string)`
  - `getAppointmentsByDate(date: string)`
  - `getFinancialSummary(period: string)`
- Use Supabase client with RLS (‚ÄúRow Level Security‚Äù)
- NEVER store/expose the Supabase service key in agent code
- Update agent endpoint to return real DB results

**Frontend**:

- Path: `apps/web/src/components/ai/DataAgentChat.tsx`
- Refine chat UI to render answers as lists, tables, or simple chart components (React)
- Example:
  - Schedule as list or mini-calendar
  - Financial summary as table/bar chart
  - Clickable details for clients/appointments

**Validation**:

- Database queries return correct, permissioned data to UI, with proper feedback for empty/error/denied requests

---

#### **FASE 3: UX & INTELLIGENCE BOOST**

**Backend**:

- Path: `apps/api/src/routes/ai/data-agent.ts`
- Improve agent ‚Äúsystem prompt‚Äù for natural language understanding (NLU):
  - Understand variations: "Agendamentos da Maria amanh√£?", "Resumo financeiro semanal"
- Enable ‚Äúfunction/tool calling‚Äù linking AI intent parsing to the right DB read methods

**Frontend**:

- Path: `apps/web/src/components/ai/`
- Use CopilotKit advanced features:
  - Rich answer rendering:
    - Custom React for lists/tables/charts in chat
    - Buttons for "Ver detalhes", "Filtrar", etc.
- Enable agent-driven UI (agent can return ‚Äúrender this chart/table‚Äù instructions)
- Rapid actions: e.g., ‚Äúmarcar como conclu√≠do‚Äù, etc via UI buttons

**Validation**:

- User can ask complex, real-world queries and see accurate, well-formatted answers
- Edge: Proper error messages and access-control in all flows

---

### 3. EXPLICIT SPECIFICATION & PROMPT (ONE-SHOT STYLE)

```yaml
role: "AI Agent Fullstack Developer (CopilotKit, AG-UI, Supabase, Node.js, React)"
objective:
  task: "Implement a conversational assistant for NeonPro, using CopilotKit (chat UI), AG-UI (protocol), and ottomator-agents/ag-ui-rag-agent (backend agent), to access and display real-time database data for clients, appointments, and finances."
  context: "Monorepo apps (web/api), production Supabase DB, secure RLS, multi-role agents/users."
chain_of_thought_process:
  analyze:
    checklist:
      - "Does agent securely read only permitted DB data?"
      - "Is UI output clear, interactive, and friendly?"
      - "Are backend endpoints protected, structured, and directly callable in a test harness?"
      - "Do frontend and agent exchange structured messages (per AG-UI spec)?"
      - "Are QA and UX test cases documented (e.g., wrong user/empty result/error)?"
  research:
    checklist:
      - "Study CopilotKit component patterns/docs"
      - "Review AG-UI event/message protocol"
      - "Check ottomator-agents RAG/AG-UI agent usage patterns"
      - "Enforce Supabase RLS and connection best practices"
      - "Lint and test TypeScript/Node code"
  think:
    step_by_step:
      - "First: Scaffold backend AP route and connect dummy agent"
      - "Then: Link chat UI to agent via AG-UI and CopilotKit"
      - "Next: Implement, test, and secure database reads (with RLS)"
      - "Finally: Polish UI, add agentic renderings (custom tables, actions), and validate with real users"
constraints:
  must:
    - "Never expose Supabase service keys in agent/backend code"
    - "All database access goes through the ai-data-service with correct RLS"
    - "Chat UI must display real, interactive answers (lists, charts)"
    - "Strict domain/user access enforced"
    - "Responsiveness and error handling in all endpoints"
    - "All agent/DB logic is unit and integration tested"
  must_not:
    - "Use fake/mock data after Fase 1"
    - "Bypass RLS or expose raw error traces to users"
    - "Leave unclear messages/answers to the end users"
    - "Reveal credentials/credentials pattern in prompt"
```

## EXAMPLES

**Input (User in NeonPro Chat):**  
"Quais os pr√≥ximos agendamentos da Maria da Silva para amanh√£?"

**Backend agent:**

- Receives query ‚Üí parses intent (user wants tomorrow's appointments for 'Maria da Silva')
- Calls `getClientByName("Maria da Silva")` ‚Üí gets client ID
- Calls `getAppointmentsByDate("YYYY-MM-DD", clientId)`
- Returns structured list for chat rendering

**Output (Frontend):**

- Responds with list of appointments for Maria da Silva, properly formatted and accessible in a chat, possibly with a quick-action button "Ver detalhes" for each item.

---

## EDGE CASES & VALIDATION

- **User requests info outside their domain/role** ‚Üí Agent returns "Acesso negado ‚Äì voc√™ n√£o tem permiss√£o para ver estes dados."
- **DB query returns empty** ‚Üí "Nenhum agendamento encontrado para Maria da Silva amanh√£."
- **Frontend loses connection** ‚Üí Inform user: "N√£o foi poss√≠vel conectar ao servidor, tente novamente."

---
