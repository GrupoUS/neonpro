# Feature Specification: Turborepo Architecture Validation Report (NeonPro)

**Feature Branch**: `001-turborepo-architecture-validation`  
**Created**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Analyze official Turborepo docs (internal packages, dependencies, structuring, configuring tasks, running tasks) and all files in `/docs/architecture/`, then produce a YAML-structured, testable validation checklist confirming whether NeonPro is correctly configured with Turborepo. Include doc references, concrete fixes, and PASS/FAIL per section. Apply A.P.T.E (Analyze ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Think ‚Üí Elaborate)."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

---## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As the project owner, I want a clear, evidence-based validation that our monorepo adheres to Turborepo best practices so that CI is reliable, developer workflows are fast, and internal packages/apps are correctly structured and wired.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given the NeonPro repository, When the validator analyzes the Turborepo docs and `/docs/architecture/*`, Then it outputs a YAML-structured checklist covering structure, dependencies, tasks, and best practices with doc references.
2. Given any deviations, When the report is generated, Then each deviation includes the violated doc/rule, a concrete fix snippet, and implications for DX/CI.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when required tasks are missing in `turbo.json`? ‚Üí The report must mark FAIL with a fix example and CI impact.
- How does the system handle uninstalled or mislinked workspace dependencies? ‚Üí The report must list them explicitly and propose install/link steps.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST analyze the five specified Turborepo docs and the local `/docs/architecture` contents.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST produce a YAML-structured validation report with explicit file references and PASS/FAIL per item.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST map each finding to a specific doc/rule and include a concrete, actionable fix example.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST include a final overall PASS/FAIL verdict and per-section verdicts.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST list missing or broken dependencies and workspace links, if any.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST highlight non-compliant repository structure or task config with references to `turbo.json` outputs.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST avoid implementation details beyond what‚Äôs needed for the fix examples; the report is for decision-making.

*Ambiguities to confirm:*
- **FR-008**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Target CI provider for referencing CI cache examples (e.g., GitHub Actions, Vercel, others)?]
- **FR-009**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Minimum required Turbo tasks (build, lint, test, type-check) to be considered must-have?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Validation Report**: A YAML document with sections: context, structure, dependencies, tasks, best practices, per-file analysis, recommendations, and verdicts.
