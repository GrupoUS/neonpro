## Unknowns and Clarifications

- CI provider reference for cache examples → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Minimum required Turbo tasks for PASS baseline → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Decisions

- Proceed with repo-local analysis using official Turborepo docs as ground truth.

## Rationale

- The feature’s goal is a validation report; concrete implementation is out of scope at this stage.

## Alternatives Considered

- Implementing a checker tool now → rejected (YAGNI); produce report first.
