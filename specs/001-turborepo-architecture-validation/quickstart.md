# Quickstart (Phase 1)

1. Read `/docs/architecture/*` for local architecture reference.
2. Review `turbo.json`, root `package.json`, and workspace package manifests.
3. Cross-check with Turborepo docs (internal packages, deps, structuring, tasks, running tasks).
4. Fill the YAML validation report template with PASS/FAIL per item and fixes.
