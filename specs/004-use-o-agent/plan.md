---

## Phase 1: Design & Architecture ✅ COMPLETE

### Design Artifacts Generated
- ✅ **data-model.md**: Complete database schema with RLS policies, realtime strategy, and validation patterns
- ✅ **quickstart.md**: Implementation guide with code examples and deployment procedures
- ✅ **Package Structure**: Defined 5-package architecture with clear boundaries
- ✅ **Runtime Separation**: Edge vs Node runtime boundaries established

### Architecture Decisions

#### 1. Package Consolidation (8 → 5)
```yaml
Current Structure:
  packages/database/          # Keep → @neonpro/database
  packages/healthcare-core/   # Merge → @neonpro/core
  packages/security/          # Merge → @neonpro/core
  packages/ai-services/       # Merge → @neonpro/core
  packages/ui/                # Keep → @neonpro/ui
  packages/utils/             # Merge → @neonpro/core
  packages/shared/            # Merge → @neonpro/core
  packages/types/             # Keep → @neonpro/types

Target Structure:
  @neonpro/database/          # Supabase integration + migrations
  @neonpro/core/              # Business logic + security + services
  @neonpro/ui/                # shadcn/ui components
  @neonpro/types/             # Generated types + Zod schemas
  @neonpro/config/            # Build + deployment config
```

#### 2. Runtime Separation Strategy
```typescript
// Edge Runtime (Read operations)
export const edgeFunctions = {
  'appointments.list': 'Edge',    // Public appointment listings
  'clinics.info': 'Edge',         // Clinic public information
  'professionals.profile': 'Edge', // Professional public profiles
  'realtime.updates': 'Edge'      // Realtime UI updates
}

// Node Runtime (Service operations)
export const nodeFunctions = {
  'appointments.create': 'Node',   // Requires service_role
  'appointments.confirm': 'Node',  // Side-effects (webhooks)
  'webhooks.supabase': 'Node',     // Background processing
  'admin.operations': 'Node'      // Service-level operations
}
```

#### 3. Multi-Tenant Security Model
```sql
-- RLS Policy Example
CREATE POLICY clinic_isolation ON appointments
    FOR ALL TO authenticated
    USING (clinic_id = auth.jwt() ->> 'clinic_id'::uuid)
    WITH CHECK (clinic_id = auth.jwt() ->> 'clinic_id'::uuid);

-- JWT Claims Structure
{
  "sub": "user_id",
  "clinic_id": "clinic_uuid",
  "role": "professional|admin|staff",
  "permissions": ["read:appointments", "write:leads"]
}
```
