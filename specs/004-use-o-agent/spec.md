## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **NeonPro Aesthetic Clinic Compliance**: Consider these mandatory requirements:
   - Brazilian aesthetic clinic regulations (LGPD, ANVISA, relevant professional councils)
   - Client data protection and privacy for aesthetic procedures
   - AI-powered prevention capabilities for no-show reduction
   - Mobile-first Brazilian experience for all aesthetic professionals
   - Type safety and data integrity for clinic operations
5. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions (clinic owners, aesthetic professionals, coordinators)
   - Data retention/deletion policies for client information
   - Performance targets and scale for aesthetic clinic workflows
   - Error handling behaviors specific to aesthetic procedures
   - Integration requirements for aesthetic clinic management
   - Security/compliance needs for cosmetic products and equipment
   - Aesthetic clinic compliance requirements

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-15

- Q: What load context should be used for performance metrics (150ms Edge response, 1.5s realtime latency)? ‚Üí A: P95 metrics under expected normal load (100 concurrent users)
- Q: What is the clinic organizational structure for multi-tenant isolation? ‚Üí A: Simple flat structure - each clinic is independent with no hierarchy
- Q: What are the data retention policies for LGPD compliance? ‚Üí A: Retain patient data for 10 years after last appointment, delete leads after 2 years of inactivity
- Q: What is the prioritization of routes for migration? ‚Üí A: All routes equally critical - maintain strict backward compatibility with no exceptions
- Q: What patient data can the AI assistant access? ‚Üí A: AI can access all patient data with proper consent logging and PII redaction

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a aesthetic clinic professional, I need the NeonPro system to be simpler and faster while maintaining all my current workflow capabilities including real-time appointment scheduling, patient communication, and AI-powered assistance, so that I can provide better care to my patients with improved system performance and reliability.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a clinic professional using the current system, **When** the refactored system is deployed, **Then** I can access all my existing features without any disruption to my daily workflow.

2. **Given** I am scheduling appointments for patients, **When** I create a new appointment, **Then** it should appear on other connected devices within 1.5 seconds without requiring a page refresh.

3. **Given** I am using the AI chatbot assistant, **When** I ask for help with patient management, **Then** the CopilotKit integration should function exactly as before with access to all relevant patient data.

4. **Given** I am a clinic administrator, **When** I access multi-tenant data, **Then** I can only view and modify data for my own clinic due to enhanced row-level security policies.

5. **Given** I am a patient receiving notifications, **When** my appointment status changes, **Then** I receive real-time updates through all configured channels.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the system experiences slow network connectivity?
- How does system handle database connection failures during realtime updates?
- What occurs when a user attempts to access data from another clinic?
- How does system behave during high-traffic periods with many concurrent appointments?
- What happens when Edge runtime functions exceed memory limits?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST preserve all existing user routes and URLs without breaking changes, with all routes equally critical and strict backward compatibility maintained with no exceptions.
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain CopilotKit integration with full AI assistant functionality, including access to all patient data with proper consent logging and PII redaction.
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable real-time updates for appointments, messages, and leads with sub-1.5s P95 latency under expected normal load (100 concurrent users).
- **FR-004**: System MUST enforce multi-tenant isolation to prevent cross-clinic data access.
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain Brazilian healthcare compliance (LGPD, ANVISA, CFM) throughout refactoring.
- **FR-006**: System MUST improve performance with Edge runtime response times under 150ms P95 under expected normal load (100 concurrent users).
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve mobile-first Brazilian experience for aesthetic professionals.
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain type safety with Zod validation throughout the application.
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure zero downtime during the migration process.
- **FR-010**: System MUST optimize package structure from current 9 packages to consolidated architecture while preserving functionality and improving maintainability.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Clinic**: Multi-tenant entity representing aesthetic clinics with isolation boundaries, using simple flat structure where each clinic is independent with no hierarchy
- **Appointment**: Real-time scheduling entity with status updates and notifications
- **Patient**: Client data with privacy protection under LGPD compliance, retained for 10 years after last appointment, leads deleted after 2 years of inactivity
- **Professional**: Healthcare provider with role-based access controls
- **Message**: Real-time communication between patients and clinic staff
- **Lead**: Potential patient management with AI-powered follow-up
- **Audit Trail**: Compliance logging for all data access and modifications
