# Execution Readiness Report: Unified PRD Index (001-unified-prd-index)

Generated: 2025-09-10
Branch: 001-unified-prd-index
Spec: specs/001-unified-prd-index/spec.md
Plan: specs/001-unified-prd-index/plan.md
Tasks: specs/001-unified-prd-index/tasks.md

## 1. Artifact Inventory
- spec.md: Enhanced v5 (traceability, compliance, clarification tracker)
- research.md: Phase 0 complete (decisions, rationale, alternatives)
- data-model.md: Entities + validation + state transitions + extensibility
- contracts/ : (API contracts TBD in implementation; design placeholders defined)
- quickstart.md: Acceptance walkthrough + sample tests + troubleshooting
- tasks.md: 36 ordered tasks with dependencies & parallel markers
- plan.md: Updated (Summary, Technical Context, Progress Tracking)

## 2. Phase & Gate Status
- Phase 0 Research: COMPLETE
- Phase 1 Design: COMPLETE
- Phase 2 Task Planning: COMPLETE (tasks.md present)
- Phase 3 Tasks Generated: COMPLETE
- Constitution Gate (Initial): PASS
- Constitution Gate (Post-Design): PASS
- Outstanding Clarifications: 4 (FR-022, FR-023, FR-024, FR-025)

## 3. Outstanding Clarifications (Blocking Before Final Implementation Sign-off)
| FR | Topic | Impact if Unresolved | Interim Mitigation |
|----|-------|----------------------|--------------------|
| 022 | KPI baseline authoritative source | Risk of misaligned normalization & trend validity | Use provisional tag + change log entry on confirmation |
| 023 | Hallucination measurement method | Cannot validate <5% threshold reliably | Define hybrid (5% manual sample + embedding similarity) draft in PR |
| 024 | AI accuracy review cadence | Governance SLA scheduling ambiguous | Assume monthly; mark with NEEDS CLARIFICATION tag |
| 025 | Environment scope for perf budgets | Risk of misconfigured staging monitoring | Assume Prod-only; add staging note pending ops approval |

## 4. Compliance & Governance Coverage
- HIPAA/LGPD clauses mapped for FR-031–FR-034 & FR-036–FR-044
- RLS + Encryption referenced in spec, data model notes, and governance sections
- QA 5×7 checklist integrated; atomic testability per FR confirmed
- Traceability matrix present for FR-036–FR-060

## 5. Risk & Simplicity Review
No complexity deviations (no extra repos, no abstraction layers beyond necessity). YAGNI applied to deferred features (predictive modeling, autonomous AI). Simplicity maintained: single canonical index, reuse existing monorepo app folders.

## 6. Task Execution Readiness
Earliest implementation path:
1. Resolve open clarifications (FR-022–FR-025)
2. Draft API contract stubs (if any) → commit with failing contract tests
3. Implement data normalization + traceability scaffolds
4. Add governance & compliance tables + validation scripts
5. Execute remaining tasks in TDD order (tests then implementation)

## 7. Quality Gates Pre-Implementation
| Gate | Target | Current | Status |
|------|--------|---------|--------|
| Spec completeness | 100% core sections | Achieved | PASS |
| Clarification closure | 0 open | 4 open | PENDING |
| Constitution simplicity | No unjustified deviation | None | PASS |
| Test-first readiness | Tasks include test ordering | Yes | PASS |
| Compliance mapping | All compliance FRs mapped | Yes | PASS |

## 8. Next Immediate Actions
1. Create clarification resolution tasks (or subtasks) for FR-022–FR-025
2. Add contract generation (if endpoints required) and failing tests
3. Begin implementation following tasks.md order

## 9. Sign-off Recommendation
Ready to proceed to implementation contingent on resolving the 4 clarification items. No structural blockers detected.
