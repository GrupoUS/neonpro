## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT development teams need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for technical stakeholders and development teams

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: Should the integration verification system actively recommend package consolidation when it finds opportunities to reduce the 20+ packages while maintaining functionality? ‚Üí A: Conservative validation - Only flag obvious duplicates, preserve current package boundaries
- Q: What criteria should the system use to identify when files are "obviously duplicate" versus appropriately separated? ‚Üí A: Functional overlap - Identify files that perform the same business function
- Q: Should the verification system include analysis of whether the current package structure aligns with the PRD objectives? ‚Üí A: PRD reference only - Use PRD as context but don't enforce alignment
- Q: What priority level should be assigned to package-related problems versus other types of integration problems? ‚Üí A: High priority - Package issues are critical and should be fixed first
- Q: What success metrics should define when the integration verification has achieved its KISS/YAGNI objectives? ‚Üí A: Both zero duplicates (no functional overlaps) AND clean imports (correct paths, no unused imports)
- Q: What performance expectations should the integration verification system meet? ‚Üí A: Fast (< 30 seconds for complete repo analysis)
- Q: What should happen when the verification system encounters critical errors that prevent analysis completion? ‚Üí A: Fail gracefully with partial results and detailed error reporting
- Q: What format should the integration verification reports use for maximum utility to development teams? ‚Üí A: JSON format for CI/CD integration with human-readable summary
- Q: What scope should the visual dependency mapping cover to be most valuable for architectural decisions? ‚Üí A: Package-to-package relationships only (high-level architecture view)
- Q: What integration should the verification system have with existing development tools? ‚Üí A: CLI tool only - developers run manually when needed

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
**Primary Objective:**
Verify complete interconnection between `/home/vibecode/neonpro/apps` and `/home/vibecode/neonpro/packages` to ensure proper linking with correct hooks, routes, and imports.

**Specific Analysis Requirements:**
1. **Import Analysis**: Map all import statements between apps and packages to identify:
   - Missing imports that should exist based on architecture docs
   - Incorrect import paths or aliases
   - Unused imports that can be removed

2. **Route Integration**: Verify that:
   - API routes in `apps/api` properly utilize services from packages
   - Frontend routes in `apps/web` correctly import and use package components
   - Route handlers have proper error handling and validation

3. **Hook Dependencies**: Ensure that:
   - React hooks in `apps/web` properly consume package utilities
   - Custom hooks are not duplicated across apps and packages
   - Hook dependencies are correctly declared

4. **File Cleanup Strategy**: Identify and create removal plan for:
   - Duplicate files with similar functionality across apps/packages
   - Redundant components, utilities, or services
   - Obsolete files that are no longer referenced
   - Unused configuration files or scripts

**Deliverables:**
- Integration verification checklist with pass/fail criteria
- Import dependency map showing current vs. expected connections
- List of files/folders marked for deletion with justification
- Action plan with prioritized steps for fixing integration issues
- Validation tests to ensure changes don't break existing functionality

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a monorepo with apps and packages, **When** running integration verification, **Then** system identifies all missing imports between apps and packages
2. **Given** API routes exist in apps/api, **When** verification runs, **Then** system confirms proper utilization of package services and validates error handling
3. **Given** React hooks in apps/web, **When** analyzing dependencies, **Then** system ensures hooks properly consume package utilities and identifies duplications
4. **Given** existing codebase, **When** verification completes, **Then** system provides prioritized cleanup strategy for duplicate/obsolete files

### Edge Cases
- What happens when circular dependencies exist between packages?
- How does system handle missing package exports that apps attempt to import?
- What occurs when hook dependencies are incorrectly declared or missing?
- How does verification handle dynamically imported modules?
- When critical errors prevent complete analysis, system provides partial results with detailed error reporting

### Success Criteria
- **Zero Functional Overlaps**: No files performing the same business function across different packages
- **Clean Import State**: All import paths correct, no unused imports, no missing dependencies
- **Package Integration Health**: All apps properly utilize package services without errors

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST analyze all import statements across 4 apps and 20+ packages to create dependency mapping
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify missing imports that should exist based on architecture documentation patterns, using PRD as contextual reference without enforcing business alignment
- **FR-003**: System MUST detect incorrect import paths, alias misconfigurations, and unused imports for cleanup, achieving clean import state as success criteria
- **FR-004**: System MUST verify API routes in apps/api properly utilize services from packages with error handling validation

- **FR-006**: System MUST validate React hooks properly consume package utilities without duplication across apps
- **FR-007**: System MUST identify files with functional overlap that perform the same business function across apps and packages, preserving current package boundaries
- **FR-008**: System MUST create conservative cleanup strategy focusing on clear redundancies without restructuring package architecture, prioritizing package-related issues as critical
- **FR-009**: System MUST generate integration verification checklist with pass/fail criteria for each validation type
- **FR-010**: System MUST produce visual dependency map showing current vs. expected connections
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide actionable remediation steps for identified integration issues, with package-related problems marked as high priority
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate changes don't break existing functionality through automated testing integration
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain healthcare compliance requirements (LGPD, ANVISA, CFM) during verification process
- **FR-014**: System MUST preserve TDD patterns and test coverage during cleanup operations
- **FR-015**: System MUST ensure changes align with Turborepo build optimization and monorepo architecture
- **FR-016**: System MUST complete full repository analysis within 30 seconds to support rapid development workflows
- **FR-017**: System MUST fail gracefully when encountering critical errors, providing partial results with detailed error reporting and recovery recommendations
- **FR-018**: System MUST generate verification reports in JSON format for CI/CD pipeline integration, accompanied by human-readable summaries for developer consumption
- **FR-019**: System MUST produce high-level package-to-package dependency maps focused on architectural relationships, avoiding file-level complexity that obscures strategic decisions

- **Import Dependency Map**: High-level visual representation of package-to-package relationships showing current vs. expected connections for architectural decision-making
- **File Cleanup Registry**: Prioritized list of duplicate/obsolete files marked for deletion with justification
- **Route Integration Matrix**: Mapping of API routes to package services with validation status
- **Hook Dependency Tracker**: Registry of React hooks and their package utility consumption patterns
