## Summary
Comprehensive analysis and organization of NeonPro monorepo structure to verify proper interconnection between `/home/vibecode/neonpro/apps` (4 applications) and `/home/vibecode/neonpro/packages` (20+ packages). Focus on import analysis, route integration verification, hook dependency mapping, and file cleanup strategy. Generate actionable integration verification checklist with prioritized cleanup tasks while maintaining healthcare compliance and TDD patterns.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.9.2 (existing NeonPro monorepo)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Existing NeonPro stack (TanStack Router, TanStack Query, tRPC v11, Valibot/Zod v4, Prisma, Supabase)  
**Storage**: File system analysis of existing structure, documentation updates  
**Testing**: Maintain existing Vitest + Playwright test coverage during cleanup  
**Target Platform**: Existing NeonPro monorepo organization  
**Project Type**: Analysis & Organization (monorepo structure verification)  
**Performance Goals**: Complete analysis and generate cleanup plan efficiently  
**Constraints**: Preserve existing functionality, maintain healthcare compliance, follow TDD patterns  
**Scale/Scope**: 4 apps + 20+ packages, maintain Turborepo build optimization

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### NeonPro Constitutional Compliance
**MANDATORY Requirements**:
- [x] **Aesthetic Clinic Compliance**: Verification maintains LGPD, ANVISA, CFM compliance during reorganization

- [x] **Type Safety**: Maintain end-to-end TypeScript safety through import verification
- [x] **Performance**: Organization improves build performance and maintains <2s response times
- [x] **Privacy by Design**: No sensitive data exposure during analysis and reorganization
- [x] **MCP Development**: Follow MCP sequence during implementation (sequential-thinking → archon → serena → tools)
- [x] **Quality Gates**: Maintain 90%+ test coverage and existing quality standards

## Phase 0: Analysis & Research ✅
**Completed**: Analysis approach for monorepo organization defined

1. **Analysis Scope Defined**:
   - Import statement mapping between apps and packages
   - Route integration verification (API and frontend)
   - Hook dependency analysis for React components
   - File duplication detection and cleanup strategy
   - Architecture compliance validation

2. **Organization Strategy**:
   - Use existing tools (serena MCP for codebase analysis)
   - Leverage TypeScript compiler for import validation
   - Follow existing monorepo patterns and conventions
   - Maintain healthcare compliance throughout process

3. **Verification Approach**:
   - Document-driven analysis using `/docs/apis` and `/docs/architecture`
   - Systematic review of import statements and dependencies
   - Integration testing validation during cleanup
   - TDD pattern preservation

**Output**: research.md with analysis methodology and organization strategy ✅

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract verification entities** → `data-model.md`:
   - Integration Verification Checklist (pass/fail criteria)
   - Import Dependency Map (apps ↔ packages connections)
   - File Cleanup Registry (duplicates and obsolete files)
   - Route Integration Matrix (API routes to package services)
   - Hook Dependency Tracker (React hooks and package utilities)
   - Architecture Compliance Report (healthcare requirements)

2. **Generate verification contracts**:
   - Verification process interface and steps
   - Expected import patterns from architecture docs
   - Cleanup validation criteria and safety checks
   - Integration test requirements during reorganization
   - Output verification contracts to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate validation tests**:
   - Import structure validation tests
   - Route integration verification tests
   - Hook dependency validation tests
   - Architecture compliance tests
   - Tests must validate existing structure first

4. **Extract verification scenarios**:
   - Complete monorepo analysis scenario
   - Import dependency validation scenario
   - File cleanup execution scenario
   - Integration preservation scenario
   - Healthcare compliance validation scenario

5. **Update agent context**:
   - Add NeonPro monorepo organization patterns
   - Include import analysis and cleanup strategies
   - Update with healthcare compliance preservation
   - Maintain focus on existing structure optimization

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, validation tests, quickstart.md, AGENTS.md update

## Phase 2: Verification Execution Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - NOT executed during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load existing monorepo structure for analysis
- Generate verification tasks from Phase 1 design docs
- Each import pattern → validation task [P]
- Each package → integration verification task [P]
- Each cleanup item → safe removal task with validation
- Integration tests for each major reorganization step

**Execution Strategy**:
- Analysis-first approach: Understand before changing
- Incremental cleanup: Small, validated changes with rollback capability
- Test preservation: Maintain all existing test coverage
- Documentation updates: Keep docs synchronized with changes
- Healthcare compliance: Validate each change preserves regulatory requirements

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 verification and organization tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: Focus on organizing existing structure, not creating new tools

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute verification and cleanup tasks)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (verify improved monorepo structure and maintained functionality)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations - reorganization aligns with all NeonPro requirements*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| None | N/A | All requirements met within constitutional framework |

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
