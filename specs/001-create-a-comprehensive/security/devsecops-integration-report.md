## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (P0-P1)

1. **Fix CSP Policy**: Update Content Security Policy to resolve script blocking
2. **Resolve Node.js Polyfill**: Configure Vite to exclude process object in browser
3. **Asset Deployment**: Fix missing static asset files (vite.svg)

### Medium Term (P2-P3)

1. **Enhanced SAST Integration**: Implement CodeQL for deeper static analysis
2. **Compliance Documentation**: Complete ANVISA and CFM assessment documentation
3. **Security Training**: Healthcare compliance training for development team

### Long Term (P4-P5)

1. **Penetration Testing**: Regular third-party security assessments
2. **Compliance Automation**: Automated compliance reporting and monitoring
3. **Incident Response**: Comprehensive security incident response procedures

**Next Actions**:

1. Coordinate with T017 (Performance Optimization) to resolve frontend loading issues
2. Continue ANVISA/CFM compliance assessment
3. Implement security remediation plan for identified vulnerabilities

**Estimated Completion**: T016 - 75% complete, ETA 10 minutes for full DevSecOps integration
