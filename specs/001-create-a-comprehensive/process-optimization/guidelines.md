## ðŸš€ MULTI-AGENT COORDINATION FRAMEWORK

### Agent Activation Matrix

#### **Primary Agents (@apex-family)**
```yaml
apex-dev:
  trigger_keywords: ["implementar", "cÃ³digo", "feature", "bug", "refatorar"]
  coordination_role: "Primary Coordinator"
  parallel_capacity: "High - can coordinate multiple specialists"
  
apex-researcher:
  trigger_keywords: ["pesquisar", "analisar", "validar", "compliance"]
  coordination_role: "Knowledge Specialist"  
  parallel_capacity: "Medium - research-intensive tasks"
  
apex-ui-ux-designer:
  trigger_keywords: ["design", "ui", "ux", "interface", "acessibilidade"]
  coordination_role: "Design Specialist"
  parallel_capacity: "High - independent design work"
```

### Coordination Patterns

#### **Parallel Execution (Safe)**
```yaml
Research_Plus_Planning:
  agents: ["@apex-researcher", "@tdd-orchestrator"]
  rationale: "Independent knowledge work, no conflicts"
  example: "T021 + T022 execution"

Quality_Plus_Security:
  agents: ["@code-reviewer", "@security-auditor"] 
  rationale: "Different analysis focuses, complementary results"
  example: "Code quality + security audit parallel"
```

#### **Sequential Execution (Required)**
```yaml
Research_Then_Development:
  sequence: ["@apex-researcher", "@apex-dev"]
  rationale: "Development needs research insights"
  example: "Technology validation â†’ Implementation"

Implementation_Then_Review:
  sequence: ["@apex-dev", "@code-reviewer"]
  rationale: "Need code to exist before reviewing"
  example: "Feature development â†’ Quality audit"
```

## ðŸ“‹ TDD ORCHESTRATION WORKFLOWS

### Phase-Based Coordination

#### **FASE 1-3: Analysis & Planning (Sequential)**
```yaml
Workflow:
  1. sequential-thinking â†’ "Problem decomposition"
  2. archon â†’ "Task setup and coordination"
  3. apex-researcher â†’ "Domain research and validation"
  4. architect-review â†’ "System design decisions"
  5. apex-dev â†’ "Implementation planning"

Rationale: "Analysis phases require cumulative understanding"
Parallel_Opportunities: "Limited - each phase builds on previous"
```

#### **FASE 4-5: Implementation & Documentation (Hybrid)**
```yaml
Sequential_Core:
  1. sequential-thinking â†’ "Implementation analysis"
  2. archon â†’ "Task coordination setup"
  3. apex-dev â†’ "Core implementation"

Parallel_Extensions:
  - apex-ui-ux-designer â†’ "UI/UX work after API contracts"
  - code-reviewer â†’ "Quality analysis of completed code"
  - security-auditor â†’ "Security review of implemented features"
  - apex-researcher â†’ "Knowledge base updates"

Rationale: "Core work sequential, quality/documentation parallel"
```

## ðŸ”§ MCP TOOL ORCHESTRATION

### Mandatory MCP Sequence

#### **Phase 1: Analysis (Always Sequential)**
```yaml
1_sequential_thinking:
  purpose: "Problem decomposition and planning"
  parallel: false
  rationale: "Thinking must happen before action"

2_archon:
  purpose: "Task management and knowledge base setup" 
  parallel: false
  rationale: "Coordination infrastructure needed first"
  
3_serena:
  purpose: "Codebase analysis and context gathering"
  parallel: false
  rationale: "Understanding current state before changes"
```

#### **Phase 2: Research (Conditional Parallel)**
```yaml
4_context7:
  purpose: "Official documentation and best practices"
  parallel: true
  condition: "Can run parallel with other research tools"
  
5_web_search:
  purpose: "Current trends and real-world implementations"
  parallel: true
  condition: "Independent of context7 results"
```

#### **Phase 3: Implementation (Mixed)**
```yaml
6_desktop_commander:
  purpose: "File operations and system commands"
  parallel: false
  rationale: "File conflicts possible, must be sequential"
```

## ðŸ“Š QUALITY GATES INTEGRATION

### Automated Checkpoints

#### **Pre-Implementation Gates**
```yaml
Research_Validation:
  trigger: "Before any code changes"
  agents: ["@apex-researcher"]
  criteria: "â‰¥90% confidence in approach"
  tools: ["context7", "web-search"]

Architecture_Review:
  trigger: "Before major implementations"
  agents: ["@architect-review", "@apex-dev"]
  criteria: "Design patterns validated"
  tools: ["archon knowledge base"]
```

#### **Post-Implementation Gates**
```yaml
Quality_Review:
  trigger: "After code completion"
  agents: ["@code-reviewer"]
  criteria: "Code quality â‰¥85/100"
  parallel: true

Security_Audit:
  trigger: "After feature completion"
  agents: ["@security-auditor"]
  criteria: "No critical vulnerabilities"
  parallel: true
```

## ðŸš¨ ANTI-PATTERNS & LESSONS LEARNED

### Critical Failures to Avoid

#### **Premature Parallelization**
```yaml
Problem: "Running implementation agents before research completion"
Impact: "Rework required, quality degradation"
Solution: "Always complete sequential-thinking â†’ research phases first"
```

#### **Uncoordinated File Operations**
```yaml
Problem: "Multiple agents writing to same files simultaneously"
Impact: "File corruption, lost work"
Solution: "Desktop-commander operations always sequential"
```

### Success Patterns Validated

#### **Research-Driven Implementation**
```yaml
Pattern: "apex-researcher â†’ apex-dev â†’ code-reviewer"
Success_Rate: "95%+"
Benefits: "Evidence-based code, fewer revisions"
```

#### **Parallel Quality Assurance**
```yaml
Pattern: "code-reviewer + security-auditor running concurrently"
Success_Rate: "100%"
Benefits: "Comprehensive analysis without time penalty"
```
