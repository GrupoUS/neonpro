# Test Strategy: Monorepo Verification Suite

**Date**: September 26, 2025  
**Agent**: @tdd-orchestrator  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive test suite design for monorepo verification with multi-agent coordination

## TDD Orchestration Framework

### Phase Definition (Red-Green-Refactor)
- **RED Phase**: Write failing tests that describe expected verification behavior
- **GREEN Phase**: Implement analysis logic to make tests pass
- **REFACTOR Phase**: Optimize while maintaining test coverage

### Test Categories

#### 1. Contract Tests (T005-T007)
**Purpose**: Validate verification logic before implementation
- `test_import_validation.ts` - Import dependency validation
- `test_route_integration.ts` - Route integration validation  
- `test_compliance_security.ts` - Healthcare compliance & security

#### 2. Integration Tests (T008-T009)
**Purpose**: Validate system integrity during verification
- `test_architecture_integrity.ts` - Architecture pattern preservation
- `test_quality_performance.ts` - Code quality & performance preservation

### Multi-Agent Coordination Strategy

#### Agent Specialization
- **@test**: Contract test implementation (T005-T006)
- **@security-auditor**: Compliance & security testing (T007)
- **@architect-review**: Architecture integrity testing (T008)
- **@code-reviewer**: Quality & performance testing (T009)
- **@tdd-orchestrator**: Coordination and strategy (T004)

#### Parallel Execution Plan
```yaml
Phase_2_TDD_RED:
  parallel_execution:
    - agent: "@test"
      tasks: ["T005", "T006"]
      focus: "Contract tests for import/route validation"
    - agent: "@security-auditor"  
      tasks: ["T007"]
      focus: "Compliance & security validation tests"
    - agent: "@architect-review"
      tasks: ["T008"] 
      focus: "Architecture integrity tests"
    - agent: "@code-reviewer"
      tasks: ["T009"]
      focus: "Quality & performance tests"
  coordination: "@tdd-orchestrator manages execution flow"
```

## Test Framework Configuration

### Test Environment Setup
```typescript
// Test configuration for verification suite
interface TestConfig {
  monorepoRoot: "/home/vibecode/neonpro";
  testTimeout: 30000; // 30 seconds
  retries: 2;
  parallel: true;
  coverage: {
    enabled: true;
    threshold: 90; // Constitutional requirement
  };
}
```

### Assertion Patterns
```typescript
// Standard assertion patterns for verification tests
interface VerificationAssertions {
  // Import validation assertions
  expectWorkspaceProtocol(importPath: string): void;
  expectValidPackageBoundary(source: string, target: string): void;
  expectNoCircularDependencies(graph: DependencyGraph): void;
  
  // Route integration assertions
  expectServiceIntegration(route: string, services: string[]): void;
  expectErrorHandling(handler: string): void;
  expectHealthcareCompliance(endpoint: string): void;
  
  // Architecture integrity assertions
  expectCleanArchitecture(boundaries: ArchitectureBoundary[]): void;
  expectDesignPatterns(patterns: DesignPattern[]): void;
  
  // Quality & performance assertions
  expectCodeQuality(metrics: QualityMetrics): void;
  expectPerformanceTargets(benchmarks: PerformanceBenchmark[]): void;
}
```

## Success Criteria for Test Phase

### RED Phase Success (Current)
- [ ] All contract tests written and failing (expected behavior)
- [ ] All integration tests written and failing (expected behavior)
- [ ] Test framework properly configured
- [ ] Multi-agent coordination functional

### GREEN Phase Preparation
- [ ] Analysis implementation ready to make tests pass
- [ ] serena MCP integration configured
- [ ] Error handling patterns established
- [ ] Performance monitoring enabled

### REFACTOR Phase Readiness
- [ ] Optimization opportunities identified
- [ ] Refactoring safety measures in place
- [ ] Quality gates defined and testable
- [ ] Multi-agent coordination optimized

## Quality Gates

### Test Quality Requirements
- **Coverage**: â‰¥90% (constitutional requirement)
- **Execution Time**: \u003c30 seconds per test suite
- **Reliability**: \u003c1% flaky test rate
- **Maintainability**: Clear test descriptions and assertions

### Coordination Quality Metrics
- **Agent Response**: \u003c5 seconds coordination overhead
- **Resource Usage**: \u003c60% system utilization during parallel execution
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic rollback on coordination failures
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time visibility into test execution
