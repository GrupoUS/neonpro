## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a** NeonPro platform stakeholder (developers, operations, compliance team, business users),  
**I want** a robust, observable, secure, and performant healthcare platform  
**So that** we can ensure patient data security, system reliability, cost efficiency, and regulatory compliance while maintaining excellent developer experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Observability & Monitoring
1. **Given** a production system running patient appointments, **When** an error occurs in any service, **Then** operations team receives immediate alerts with full context and tracing information
2. **Given** AI features are being used for patient interactions, **When** monitoring cost and token usage, **Then** business team can track AI expenses per clinic and optimize budget allocation
3. **Given** system performance metrics, **When** latency exceeds healthcare-critical thresholds, **Then** automatic scaling and alerting mechanisms activate

#### Security & Compliance
1. **Given** patient data processing activities, **When** LGPD audit requirements need verification, **Then** complete audit trails are available with data retention policies enforced
2. **Given** web application security requirements, **When** external assets are loaded, **Then** Content Security Policy prevents malicious script injection while maintaining functionality
3. **Given** authentication security needs, **When** users log in, **Then** modern password hashing (Argon2id) protects credentials with appropriate computational costs

#### Performance & User Experience
1. **Given** healthcare professionals using mobile devices (70%+ usage), **When** accessing patient dashboards, **Then** initial page load completes under 2 seconds with progressive loading
2. **Given** large appointment scheduling interfaces, **When** navigating between sections, **Then** code splitting ensures minimal bundle sizes and instant transitions
3. **Given** AI-powered features, **When** similar queries are made, **Then** semantic caching reduces response time and token costs

#### Developer Experience & Quality
1. **Given** API development workflows, **When** creating new endpoints, **Then** automatic OpenAPI documentation generates with type safety validation
2. **Given** frontend component development, **When** building accessible interfaces, **Then** automated accessibility testing prevents WCAG violations in CI pipeline
3. **Given** code generation needs, **When** creating new features, **Then** standardized generators create route + schema + test files consistently

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Sentry/monitoring services are temporarily unavailable?
- How does system handle rate limiting during peak clinic hours?
- What occurs when AI failover from OpenAI to Claude is triggered?
- How does semantic caching handle memory pressure scenarios?
- What happens when CSP policies conflict with dynamic content requirements?
