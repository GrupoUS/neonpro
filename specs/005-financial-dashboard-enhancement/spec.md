## User Scenarios & Testing *(enhanced)*

### Primary User Story
As a clinic administrator managing a Brazilian aesthetic clinic, I need a comprehensive, interactive financial dashboard that displays key business metrics, revenue trends, and operational performance indicators through intuitive charts and visualizations, so I can make informed business decisions, ensure regulatory compliance, and monitor the clinic's financial health effectively while maintaining LGPD data protection standards.

### Enhanced Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am logged in as a clinic administrator, **When** I navigate to the Financeiro page, **Then** I see a modern dashboard with interactive chart widgets displaying real financial metrics using experiment-03 Shadcn components
2. **Given** I am viewing the financial dashboard, **When** I select a different date range using the date picker, **Then** all charts update smoothly to reflect data for the selected period with loading states
3. **Given** I am viewing revenue charts, **When** I click on a specific data point, **Then** I can drill down to see detailed breakdown with tooltips and contextual information
4. **Given** I need to share financial data for compliance, **When** I click the export button, **Then** I can download dashboard data in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, CSV) with audit logging
5. **Given** I am accessing the dashboard on mobile device, **When** I view and interact with charts, **Then** they are fully responsive with touch-friendly interactions and swipe gestures
6. **Given** I am a financial manager, **When** I access the dashboard, **Then** I see only the financial data permitted by my role with appropriate restrictions
7. **Given** I am viewing client lifetime value metrics, **When** I analyze the CLV distribution chart, **Then** I can identify high-value clients and revenue optimization opportunities
8. **Given** I need to monitor treatment room utilization, **When** I view the operational metrics, **Then** I can see room efficiency trending toward the 80-85% optimal range

### Compliance & Edge Cases
- **LGPD Compliance**: What happens when a patient requests data deletion or export of their financial records?
- **Role-Based Access**: How does the system handle role changes and permission updates in real-time?
- **Data Privacy**: What occurs when unauthorized access attempts are made to sensitive financial data?
- **Audit Requirements**: How are all financial data access and export activities logged for compliance?
- **Performance**: What happens when displaying large datasets (1000+ transactions) on mobile devices?
- **Real-time Updates**: How does the system handle concurrent access when multiple users are viewing financial data?
