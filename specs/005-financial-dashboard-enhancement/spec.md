## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a clinic administrator, I need a comprehensive financial dashboard that displays key business metrics, revenue trends, and operational performance indicators in an intuitive, interactive format, so I can make informed business decisions and monitor the clinic's financial health effectively.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am logged in as a clinic administrator, **When** I navigate to the Financeiro page, **Then** I see a modern dashboard with multiple chart widgets displaying current financial metrics
2. **Given** I am viewing the financial dashboard, **When** I select a different date range, **Then** all charts update to reflect data for the selected period
3. **Given** I am viewing revenue charts, **When** I click on a specific data point, **Then** I can drill down to see detailed breakdown of that metric
4. **Given** I need to share financial data, **When** I click the export button, **Then** I can download the dashboard data in PDF or Excel format
5. **Given** I am accessing the dashboard on mobile, **When** I view the charts, **Then** they are properly responsive and touch-friendly

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no financial data is available for the selected period?
- How does the system handle real-time data updates when multiple users are viewing simultaneously?
- What occurs when export functionality fails due to large dataset size?
- How are loading states and data refresh handled during peak usage times?
