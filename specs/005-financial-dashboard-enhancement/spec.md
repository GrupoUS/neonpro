## User Scenarios & Testing _(enhanced with Constitution v1.2.0)_

### Primary User Story

As a clinic administrator managing a Brazilian aesthetic clinic, I need a comprehensive, interactive financial dashboard that displays key business metrics, revenue trends, and operational performance indicators through intuitive charts and visualizations with HTTPS/TLS 1.3 security and biometric authentication, so I can make informed business decisions, ensure regulatory compliance, and monitor the clinic's financial health effectively while maintaining LGPD data protection standards.

### Enhanced Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am logged in as a clinic administrator using WebAuthn biometric authentication, **When** I navigate to the Financeiro page, **Then** I see a modern dashboard with interactive chart widgets displaying real financial metrics using experiment-03 Shadcn components with HSTS security headers
2. **Given** I am viewing the financial dashboard, **When** I select a different date range using the date picker, **Then** all charts update smoothly to reflect data for the selected period with loading states and HTTPS-secured data transmission
3. **Given** I am viewing revenue charts, **When** I click on a specific data point, **Then** I can drill down to see detailed breakdown with interactive tooltips and contextual information encrypted with AES-256
4. **Given** I need to share financial data for compliance, **When** I click the export button, **Then** I can download dashboard data in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, CSV) with LGPD-compliant audit logging and JOSE token validation
5. **Given** I am accessing the dashboard on mobile device, **When** I view and interact with charts, **Then** they are fully responsive with touch-friendly interactions and swipe gestures meeting performance requirements (<2.5s LCP)
6. **Given** I am a financial manager, **When** I access the dashboard, **Then** I see only the financial data permitted by my 5-tier role-based access system with appropriate restrictions
7. **Given** I am viewing client lifetime value metrics, **When** I analyze the CLV distribution chart, **Then** I can identify high-value clients and revenue optimization opportunities with tRPC type-safe data fetching
8. **Given** I need to monitor treatment room utilization, **When** I view the operational metrics, **Then** I can see room efficiency trending toward the 80-85% optimal range with real-time updates

### Compliance & Edge Cases

- **LGPD Compliance**: What happens when a patient requests data deletion or export of their financial records with immediate effect processing?
- **Role-Based Access**: How does the system handle role changes and permission updates in real-time with WebAuthn biometric verification?
- **Data Privacy**: What occurs when unauthorized access attempts are made to sensitive financial data protected by TLS 1.3 and comprehensive security headers?
- **Audit Requirements**: How are all financial data access and export activities logged for compliance with automatic certificate renewal and transparency?
- **Performance**: What happens when displaying large datasets (1000+ transactions) on mobile devices with TypeScript 5.9.2 strict mode optimizations?
- **Real-time Updates**: How does the system handle concurrent access when multiple users are viewing financial data through tRPC v11.0.0 APIs?
