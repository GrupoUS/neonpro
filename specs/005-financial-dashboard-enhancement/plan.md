**Scale/Scope**: 15+ chart components, 5-tier permission system, 10k+ financial records

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Aesthetic Clinic Compliance Gates
- [x] **Healthcare-First Development**: Feature prioritizes financial transparency and data privacy (LGPD) with RLS enforcement
- [x] **AI-Native Architecture**: Systems designed with AI integration for financial insights and predictive analytics
- [x] **Test-Driven Healthcare**: TDD mandatory for financial-critical features with proper test cases
- [x] **Brazilian Regulatory Compliance**: All code complies with LGPD, ANVISA, CFM standards with audit logging
- [x] **Performance for Clinical Environments**: Meets clinical-grade performance standards (<2s load, <500ms interactions)
- [x] **HTTPS Security**: Implements HTTPS Everywhere with TLS 1.3+, HSTS, and comprehensive security headers
- [x] **Security & Privacy**: Implements data protection, role-based access control, and audit trails
- [x] **Quality Gates**: Healthcare testing requirements, code quality standards, and performance requirements met

### Technology Stack Validation
- [x] Frontend: Uses TanStack Router + Vite + React 19, TypeScript 5.9.2, Shadcn MCP (compatible with existing stack)
- [x] Backend: Uses tRPC v11.0.0, Supabase with RLS, comprehensive audit logging
- [x] Infrastructure: Uses existing monorepo structure, comprehensive testing with Vitest/Playwright
- [x] **Authentication & Authorization Stack**: Supabase Auth v2.38.5, WebAuthn biometric, JOSE library integration
- [x] **HTTPS Implementation Standards**: TLS 1.3+, HSTS enforcement, security headers, certificate management
- [x] **Password Security**: bcryptjs v2.4.3 with migration path to Argon2id for enhanced security

### Constitutional Compliance Assessment
- [x] KISS Principle: Using proven frameworks (Shadcn MCP, Recharts) rather than custom charting implementation
- [x] YAGNI Principle: Building only enhanced dashboard features, not full financial ERP system
- [x] Chain of Thought: Clear phased approach with validation at each step
- [x] A.P.T.E Methodology: Analysis → Planning → Thinking → Execution workflow followed

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - integrates with existing NeonPro web structure

## Phase 0: Outline & Research ✅

**Status**: COMPLETED via apex-researcher agent

**Research Completed**:

- ✅ **Shadcn MCP Integration**: experiment-03 registry analysis, component compatibility
- ✅ **Financial KPIs for Aesthetic Clinics**: client lifetime value, conversion rates, utilization metrics
- ✅ **User Permission System**: 5-tier LGPD-compliant access control
- ✅ **Brazilian Healthcare Compliance**: LGPD, ANVISA, CFM requirements integration
- ✅ **Performance Optimization**: Recharts integration, mobile responsiveness, caching strategies
- ✅ **Current NeonPro Architecture**: Supabase integration, authentication patterns, theme system

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved ✅

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts ✅

**Status**: COMPLETED via apex-researcher agent

**Artifacts Created**:

1. **data-model.md** ✅: Complete database schema with 4 core entities
   - Financial metrics, revenue streams, performance indicators, user preferences
   - LGPD compliance features, audit logging, encryption at rest
   - Performance optimizations: partitioning, indexing, materialized views

2. **contracts/** ✅: API specifications for all endpoints
   - Dashboard data aggregation endpoints
   - Real-time WebSocket specifications
   - Export functionality contracts
   - Authentication and authorization patterns

3. **quickstart.md** ✅: Developer setup and getting started guide
   - Environment setup with Shadcn MCP
   - Database initialization procedures
   - Component development workflow
   - Testing and validation protocols

4. **Contract tests** ✅: Failing tests for TDD implementation
   - API endpoint validation tests
   - Component integration tests
   - User story validation scenarios

**Output**: Complete design artifacts with failing tests ready for implementation ✅

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base structure
- Generate 40+ granular tasks from Phase 1 design documents
- Each API contract → contract test task [P] (parallel execution)
- Each chart component → development task with mobile optimization
- Each user story → integration test task with accessibility validation
- Constitutional compliance tasks → LGPD audit, ANVISA validation, CFM standards

**Ordering Strategy**:

- **TDD Strict Order**: Tests written and failing before any implementation
- **Dependency Hierarchy**: Database migrations → API contracts → chart components → dashboard integration
- **Parallel Execution**: Mark [P] for independent tasks (component development, test creation)
- **Quality Gates**: Performance testing, accessibility validation, compliance audits

**Task Categories**:

1. **Foundation Setup** (Days 1-2): Shadcn MCP, database schema, authentication integration
2. **Core Components** (Days 3-5): Chart components with Recharts, interactive features
3. **Dashboard Integration** (Days 6-7): Layout system, real-time updates, mobile optimization
4. **Advanced Features** (Days 8-9): Export functionality, performance optimization, AI insights
5. **Testing & Compliance** (Day 10): Comprehensive testing, LGPD audit, deployment validation

**Estimated Output**: 40+ numbered, ordered tasks with constitutional compliance checkpoints

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md with detailed breakdown)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (TDD cycle execution following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (comprehensive testing, performance benchmarks, compliance audit)

## Complexity Tracking

_No constitutional violations requiring justification_

All complexity decisions align with constitutional principles:

- Shadcn MCP components chosen for proven compatibility and performance
- Multi-tier permission system required for LGPD compliance
- Real-time updates necessary for operational decision-making
- Mobile-first approach mandatory for 70%+ mobile usage compliance

## Progress Tracking

**Gate Status**:

- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS ✅
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS ✅
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved ✅
