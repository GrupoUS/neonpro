// Data caching with TanStack Query
const financialDataQuery = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['financial-metrics', dateRange],
  queryFn: () => fetchFinancialMetrics(dateRange),
  staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
  cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
});
```

#### Mobile Performance Targets
- **Initial Load**: <2 seconds on 3G network
- **Chart Render**: <500ms per chart component  
- **Interaction Response**: <100ms for touch/click
- **Bundle Size**: <100KB additional overhead

## 🛡️ Security & Compliance Implementation

### LGPD Compliance Architecture

#### Data Protection Measures
```typescript
// Audit logging for financial data access
interface FinancialAuditLog {
  user_id: string;
  action: 'view' | 'export' | 'modify';
  data_type: 'revenue' | 'patient_financial' | 'reports';
  timestamp: DateTime;
  ip_address: string;
  user_agent: string;
}

// Role-based data filtering
const getFinancialData = async (userRole: UserRole) => {
  const query = supabase
    .from('financial_transactions')
    .select(getPermittedFields(userRole));
  
  return applyRoleBasedFilters(query, userRole);
};
```

#### Encryption & Security
