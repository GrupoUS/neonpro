# Research: Monorepo Architecture Audit and Optimization

**Date**: 2025-09-09
**Scope**: Technology evaluation and best practices for monorepo audit tooling

## AST Parsing Libraries for TypeScript Analysis

### Decision: ts-morph

**Why Chosen**:

- High-level API wrapper around TypeScript Compiler API
- Simplified navigation and manipulation of TypeScript AST
- Built-in type checking and symbol resolution
- Active maintenance and strong community support
- Direct access to TypeScript's type system and compiler behavior

**Rationale**:

- Provides easier API compared to raw TypeScript Compiler API
- Handles complexities of AST traversal and analysis
- Supports both parsing and transformation operations
- Well-documented with extensive examples
- Performance suitable for monorepo scale analysis (100k+ files)

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **TypeScript Compiler API (direct)**: More complex, lower-level access
- **Babel Parser**: JavaScript-focused, limited TypeScript support
- **ts-simple-ast** (deprecated): Predecessor to ts-morph, no longer maintained
- **SWC Parser**: Rust-based, faster but limited TypeScript analysis capabilities

## Turborepo Workspace Detection and Configuration

### Decision: Package.json + Turbo.json Analysis

**Why Chosen**:

- Standard workspace detection via package.json "workspaces" field
- Turborepo-specific configuration in turbo.json
- Lockfile analysis for dependency relationships
- Support for multiple package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun)

**Rationale**:

- Workspaces field defines monorepo structure clearly
- Turbo.json contains pipeline configuration and caching rules
- Lockfiles provide accurate dependency graphs
- Industry standard approach used by existing tools

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **Lerna configuration**: Less common in modern setups
- **Manual directory scanning**: Error-prone and incomplete
- **Git-based detection**: Doesn't reflect workspace boundaries
- **Custom configuration files**: Non-standard approach

## File System Traversal Patterns for Large Monorepos

### Decision: Node.js fs.promises with concurrent processing

**Why Chosen**:

- Native Node.js support with optimal performance
- Promise-based async/await pattern for clean code
- Concurrent directory traversal with controlled parallelism
- Memory-efficient streaming for large file sets

**Rationale**:

- Built-in performance optimizations
- No external dependencies required
- Precise control over traversal depth and filtering
- Efficient handling of 50k+ file monorepos
- Integration with ignore patterns (.gitignore, .turboignore)

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **fs-extra**: Additional utility functions but unnecessary overhead
- **glob patterns**: Less control over traversal optimization
- **walk-sync**: Synchronous operation, blocking performance
- **recursive-readdir**: Limited filtering and control options

## Dependency Graph Algorithms

### Decision: Topological Sort with Cycle Detection

**Why Chosen**:

- Industry standard for dependency analysis
- Efficient cycle detection using DFS with coloring
- Supports both direct and transitive dependency analysis
- Handles complex import patterns including dynamic imports

**Rationale**:

- O(V + E) time complexity suitable for large graphs
- Clear identification of circular dependencies
- Supports different import types (static, dynamic, require)
- Well-established algorithm with proven reliability

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **Simple adjacency list**: No cycle detection
- **Tarjan's algorithm**: More complex, unnecessary for this use case
- **Union-Find**: Not suitable for dependency ordering
- **BFS traversal**: Doesn't detect cycles effectively

## Safe File Cleanup with Rollback Mechanisms

### Decision: Transaction-like Operations with Backup Strategy

**Why Chosen**:

- Create backup metadata before any file operations
- Atomic operations where possible using filesystem moves
- Detailed operation logging for rollback reconstruction
- Dry-run mode for validation before actual cleanup

**Rationale**:

- Prevents data loss through comprehensive backup strategy
- Transaction log enables precise rollback operations
- Atomic moves reduce risk of partial operations
- Validation mode builds confidence before execution

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **Git stashing**: Limited to git-tracked files
- **Symbolic links**: Platform compatibility issues
- **Full directory backup**: Excessive disk usage for large repos
- **Database transactions**: Unnecessary complexity for file operations

## Hono and TanStack Router Integration Patterns

### Decision: Route Declaration Analysis + Import Tracing

**Why Chosen**:

- Parse Hono route declarations (app.get, app.post, etc.)
- Trace TanStack Router route configurations and components
- Analyze file-based routing patterns and dynamic imports
- Cross-reference with actual component usage

**Rationale**:

- Hono uses explicit route declaration that's easily parseable
- TanStack Router provides clear route configuration structures
- File-based routing follows predictable patterns
- Dynamic imports require AST analysis for proper detection

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **Runtime analysis**: Requires executing code, security risk
- **Regex parsing**: Brittle for complex routing patterns
- **Manual configuration**: Not scalable for large codebases
- **Third-party routing analyzers**: Limited framework support

## Technology Stack Validation

### Decision: Schema-based Architecture Document Validation

**Why Chosen**:

- Parse source-tree.md and tech-stack.md as structured documents
- Define validation schemas for architectural patterns
- Cross-reference actual code structure with documented standards
- Generate compliance reports with specific violations

**Rationale**:

- Documented architecture provides clear validation targets
- Schema validation ensures consistent rule application
- Automated compliance checking scales across large codebases
- Clear reporting enables actionable improvements

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **Manual code review**: Not scalable for large monorepos
- **Static analysis rules**: Too rigid for architectural patterns
- **Convention-based validation**: Assumptions without documentation
- **Custom DSL**: Unnecessary complexity for validation rules

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Decision: Concurrent Analysis with Progress Reporting

**Why Chosen**:

- Parallel file processing with worker pool pattern
- Progress tracking and cancellation support
- Memory-efficient streaming for large file analysis
- Incremental results output for immediate feedback

**Rationale**:

- Target: Process 10k+ files within 30 seconds
- Memory constraint: <500MB for large monorepo analysis
- User experience: Real-time progress feedback
- Scalability: Handle monorepos with 100+ packages

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **Single-threaded processing**: Too slow for large codebases
- **Full parallel processing**: Memory exhaustion risk
- **Batch processing**: Poor user experience for progress tracking
- **External process spawning**: Overhead and complexity

## Implementation Architecture Summary

**Final Technology Stack**:

- **AST Parser**: ts-morph (TypeScript analysis)
- **File System**: Node.js fs.promises (concurrent traversal)
- **Workspace Detection**: package.json + turbo.json analysis
- **Dependency Analysis**: Topological sort with cycle detection
- **Cleanup Strategy**: Transaction-log with atomic operations
- **Routing Analysis**: Framework-specific pattern parsing
- **Validation**: Schema-based architecture compliance
- **Performance**: Concurrent worker pools with progress tracking

**Key Technical Decisions**:

1. Native Node.js APIs for maximum performance and minimal dependencies
2. AST-based analysis for accuracy over regex pattern matching
3. Transaction-safe cleanup operations with comprehensive rollback
4. Schema-driven validation for architectural compliance
5. Concurrent processing with memory and performance constraints

- Hono route declaration analysis
- TanStack Router configuration tracing
- Architecture document schema validation
- Progress reporting and user feedback systems
