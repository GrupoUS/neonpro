## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → ✅ LOADED: TanStack Query optimization for NeonPro healthcare platform
   → ✅ EXTRACTED: TypeScript 5.7.2, TanStack Query v5.87.1, React 19, Next.js 15
2. Load optional design documents:

   → ✅ contracts/: query-optimization.ts with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
   → ✅ research.md: 6 technical decisions with implementation priorities
   → ✅ quickstart.md: Step-by-step implementation and validation scenarios
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → ✅ Setup: Project structure, dependencies, configuration
   → ✅ Tests: Contract tests, integration tests, performance tests
   → ✅ Core: Query patterns, cache strategies, optimistic updates
   → ✅ Integration: Prefetching, compliance, developer utilities
   → ✅ Polish: Performance validation, documentation, cleanup
4. Apply task rules:
   → ✅ Different files = marked [P] for parallel execution
   → ✅ Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → ✅ Tests before implementation (TDD enforced)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → ✅ All contracts have tests
   → ✅ All entities have implementation tasks
   → ✅ All optimization patterns covered
9. Return: SUCCESS (25 tasks ready for execution)

- Audit data: Always fresh, 2-minute retention (T020)
- Data access logging: All query operations (T030)
- Consent validation: Before data access (T028)

### ANVISA Requirements (Preserved)

- Medical data integrity validation (T029)
- Healthcare professional access control (T019)
- Medical device operation logging (T030)
- Data consistency verification (T031-T033)

### Performance Targets

- **Cache Hit Rate**: 85-90% (vs current 75-80%)
- **Perceived Performance**: +25% improvement
- **Bundle Size**: ≤45KB gzipped (maintained)
- **Development Speed**: +30% improvement
- **Type Safety**: 100% coverage

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts**: query-optimization.ts → 5 contract tests (T005-T009)
2. **From Data Model**: 5 entities → 5 implementation categories
3. **From Research**: 6 technical decisions → 6 implementation phases
4. **From Quickstart**: 10 validation scenarios → 10 test tasks
