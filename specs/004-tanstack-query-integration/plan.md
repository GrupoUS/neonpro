# Implementation Plan: TanStack Query Integration Analysis and Optimization

**Branch**: `004-tanstack-query-integration` | **Date**: 2025-01-09 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/vibecoder/neonpro/specs/004-tanstack-query-integration/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → ✅ LOADED: Feature spec successfully loaded
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → ✅ COMPLETED: Project Type = web (frontend+backend), Structure Decision = Option 2
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → ✅ PASSED: No violations detected, healthcare compliance maintained
   → ✅ UPDATE: Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → ✅ COMPLETED: All technical unknowns resolved
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
   → ✅ COMPLETED: Design artifacts generated
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → ✅ PASSED: No new violations, design maintains simplicity
   → ✅ UPDATE: Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
   → ✅ COMPLETED: Task generation strategy defined
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

**Primary Requirement**: Optimize existing TanStack Query implementation in NeonPro healthcare platform to enhance performance, type safety, and developer experience while maintaining healthcare compliance (LGPD/ANVISA) and preserving all existing functionality.

**Technical Approach**: Implement additive enhancements using TanStack Query v5 best practices including queryOptions pattern, optimistic updates, intelligent caching strategies, and enhanced developer utilities. All changes are backward-compatible with gradual migration strategy.

## Technical Context

**Primary Dependencies**: @tanstack/react-query ^5.87.1, React 19.1.1, Next.js 15, Supabase ^2.45.1\
**Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS)\
**Testing**: Vitest ^3.2.0, Testing Library ^16.3.0, Playwright ^1.40.0\
**Target Platform**: Web application (Next.js 15 + React 19) with Turborepo monorepo\
**Project Type**: web - determines source structure (frontend + backend)\
**Performance Goals**: 25% faster perceived performance, 85-90% cache hit rate, <2s AI response time\
**Constraints**: Zero breaking changes, LGPD/ANVISA compliance maintained, healthcare data safety\
**Scale/Scope**: Healthcare platform with patient/appointment management, real-time updates, AI chat

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - NeonPro is a healthcare web platform with frontend and backend

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - ✅ All technical context is well-defined (no NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   - ✅ TanStack Query v5 patterns and best practices
   - ✅ Healthcare compliance requirements for query optimization
   - ✅ Performance optimization strategies for healthcare data

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   ✅ Task: "Research TanStack Query v5 queryOptions pattern for type safety"
   ✅ Task: "Find best practices for optimistic updates in healthcare workflows"
   ✅ Task: "Research intelligent caching strategies for real-time healthcare data"
   ✅ Task: "Analyze performance optimization patterns for large healthcare datasets"
   ✅ Task: "Research healthcare compliance considerations for query caching"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all technical decisions documented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Query Patterns (current vs optimized)
   - Cache Strategies (healthcare-specific configurations)
   - Performance Metrics (measurable indicators)
   - Compliance Mappings (LGPD/ANVISA requirements)
   - Integration Points (Supabase, real-time, audit logging)

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Query optimization interfaces
   - Cache management contracts
   - Performance monitoring APIs
   - Healthcare compliance validation contracts
   - Output TypeScript interfaces to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Query pattern validation tests
   - Cache behavior verification tests
   - Performance benchmark tests
   - Compliance requirement tests
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Developer experience improvement scenarios
   - Performance optimization validation scenarios
   - Healthcare compliance preservation scenarios
   - Backward compatibility verification scenarios

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh claude` for Claude AI assistant
   - Add TanStack Query optimization context
   - Preserve healthcare compliance requirements
   - Update with current optimization patterns
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root as CLAUDE.md

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each optimization pattern → implementation task [P]
- Each performance metric → validation task [P]
- Each compliance requirement → verification task
- Each test scenario → test implementation task

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Query patterns → Cache strategies → Performance optimizations
- Healthcare compliance: Validation at each step
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent optimizations)

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)\
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)\
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_No constitutional violations detected - all optimizations maintain simplicity and healthcare compliance_

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| None      | N/A        | N/A                                  |
