## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a **healthcare platform developer**, I need to understand how TanStack Query can be optimized within the existing NeonPro architecture so that data management becomes more efficient, healthcare-compliant, and performant while maintaining all existing functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the current TanStack Query implementation in NeonPro, **When** an analysis is performed, **Then** specific optimization opportunities are identified with measurable impact metrics
2. **Given** existing data management patterns, **When** TanStack Query best practices are applied, **Then** performance improvements are documented with before/after comparisons
3. **Given** healthcare compliance requirements (LGPD/ANVISA), **When** query patterns are optimized, **Then** all compliance features remain intact and potentially enhanced
4. **Given** the current codebase structure, **When** integration recommendations are provided, **Then** they preserve existing API contracts and module boundaries

### Edge Cases

- What happens when optimization recommendations conflict with existing healthcare compliance patterns?
- How does the system handle migration scenarios where both old and new patterns coexist?
- What safeguards ensure that optimization doesn't break real-time healthcare data requirements?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST analyze current TanStack Query implementation patterns across all NeonPro applications and packages
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify specific optimization opportunities that improve performance without breaking existing functionality
- **FR-003**: Analysis MUST provide measurable metrics for each optimization recommendation (performance gains, bundle size reduction, etc.)
- **FR-004**: System MUST ensure all optimization recommendations maintain healthcare data compliance (LGPD/ANVISA requirements)
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve existing API contracts and module boundaries during optimization
- **FR-006**: Analysis MUST include migration strategies that allow gradual implementation without system downtime
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide concrete code examples showing before/after patterns for each recommendation
- **FR-008**: Optimization recommendations MUST be compatible with existing Turborepo monorepo structure
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate that optimizations maintain real-time data requirements for healthcare operations
- **FR-010**: Analysis MUST include rollback strategies for each proposed optimization

### Key Entities _(data management patterns)_

- **Query Patterns**: Current TanStack Query usage patterns across patient, appointment, and healthcare data management
- **Cache Strategies**: Existing caching configurations and optimization opportunities for healthcare-specific data
- **Performance Metrics**: Measurable indicators of current vs. optimized data management performance
- **Compliance Mappings**: Relationships between TanStack Query patterns and healthcare regulatory requirements
- **Integration Points**: Connections between TanStack Query and existing NeonPro services (Supabase, real-time updates, audit logging)
