# Research: TanStack Query Integration Analysis and Optimization

**Feature**: TanStack Query Integration Analysis and Optimization\
**Date**: 2025-01-09\
**Status**: Complete

## Research Findings

### 1. TanStack Query v5 queryOptions Pattern

**Decision**: Implement queryOptions pattern for enhanced type safety and centralized configuration

**Rationale**:

- Provides 100% type inference across query usage
- Centralizes query configuration (staleTime, gcTime, queryFn)
- Enables better IDE support and autocomplete
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing patterns
- Recommended by TanStack Query v5 documentation as best practice

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Keep existing query key + queryFn pattern: Rejected due to type safety limitations
- Custom query factory pattern: Rejected due to complexity and maintenance overhead
- Third-party query builders: Rejected due to additional dependencies

**Implementation Approach**:

```typescript
// Enhanced pattern with queryOptions
export const patientQueries = {
  detail: (id: string,) =>
    queryOptions({
      queryKey: ['patients', 'detail', id,],
      queryFn: () => fetchPatient(id,),
      staleTime: HealthcareQueryConfig.patient.staleTime,
    },),
}
```

### 2. Optimistic Updates for Healthcare Workflows

**Decision**: Implement optimistic updates with healthcare-specific rollback strategies

**Rationale**:

- Improves perceived performance for healthcare staff
- Provides immediate UI feedback for critical operations
- Maintains data consistency with proper error handling
- Essential for healthcare workflows where speed matters
- TanStack Query provides robust optimistic update patterns

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Server-side optimizations only: Rejected due to network latency impact
- Client-side caching without optimistic updates: Rejected due to poor UX
- Custom optimistic update implementation: Rejected due to complexity

**Healthcare-Specific Considerations**:

- Rollback strategies for patient data modifications
- Audit trail preservation during optimistic operations
- LGPD compliance during temporary state changes
- Real-time synchronization with Supabase

### 3. Intelligent Caching Strategies

**Decision**: Implement healthcare-optimized caching with intelligent prefetching

**Rationale**:

- Healthcare workflows are predictable (patient → appointments → records)
- Prefetching reduces wait times for critical healthcare operations
- Cache warming improves performance for common workflows
- Maintains healthcare compliance with proper cache expiration

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Aggressive caching without healthcare considerations: Rejected due to compliance risks
- No prefetching strategy: Rejected due to performance impact
- Third-party caching solutions: Rejected due to complexity and vendor lock-in

**Healthcare Workflow Patterns**:

- Patient selection → prefetch appointments and medical records
- Appointment scheduling → prefetch availability and professional data
- Emergency workflows → immediate cache warming for critical data

### 4. Performance Optimization Patterns

**Decision**: Implement structural sharing and optimized infinite queries for large healthcare datasets

**Rationale**:

- Healthcare platforms handle large datasets (patients, appointments, records)
- Structural sharing reduces memory usage and improves performance
- Infinite queries with optimization prevent memory leaks
- Essential for clinic-scale operations with thousands of records

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Pagination without infinite queries: Rejected due to poor UX
- Client-side data virtualization: Rejected due to complexity
- Server-side pagination only: Rejected due to network overhead

**Optimization Techniques**:

- maxPages limit to prevent memory issues
- Structural sharing for better performance
- Optimized select functions for data transformation
- Healthcare-specific data filtering

### 5. Healthcare Compliance for Query Optimization

**Decision**: Maintain and enhance LGPD/ANVISA compliance throughout optimization

**Rationale**:

- Healthcare data requires strict compliance with Brazilian regulations
- Query optimizations must not compromise data protection
- Audit logging must be preserved and enhanced
- Cache expiration must respect healthcare data retention policies

**Compliance Requirements**:

- LGPD: Data minimization, consent tracking, audit trails
- ANVISA: Medical device validation, data integrity
- Healthcare regulations: Patient data protection, access logging

**Implementation Strategy**:

- Enhanced audit logging for query operations
- Compliance-aware cache expiration policies
- Data access tracking for optimized queries
- Automated compliance validation

### 6. Developer Experience Enhancements

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive developer utilities and debugging tools

**Rationale**:

- Healthcare development requires robust debugging capabilities
- Query state visibility is crucial for healthcare data operations
- Performance monitoring helps maintain healthcare service quality
- Developer productivity directly impacts healthcare delivery

**Developer Tools**:

- Query state debugging utilities
- Performance monitoring and metrics
- Healthcare-specific cache analysis
- Automated query health checks
