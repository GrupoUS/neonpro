## Research Methodology

### 1. **Official Documentation Review**

- Start with official documentation for each technology
- Focus on "Best Practices" and "Patterns" sections
- Extract specific code examples and conventions
- Document decision rationales from technology creators

### 2. **Healthcare Context Integration**

- Map generic best practices to healthcare-specific scenarios
- Identify patterns that align with LGPD compliance
- Focus on security and audit trail requirements
- Consider Brazilian healthcare workflows

### 3. **Validation Against Existing Codebase**

- Cross-reference recommendations with existing NeonPro patterns
- Identify gaps in current implementation
- Prioritize recommendations by impact and adoption difficulty
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing code

## Expected Outputs

### Research Documentation

- **Decision**: Specific pattern or practice chosen
- **Rationale**: Why this approach was selected
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options evaluated
- **Healthcare Context**: How it applies to NeonPro specifically
- **Implementation Examples**: Concrete code patterns

### Quality Gates

- All technologies researched with official sources cited
- Healthcare compliance considerations documented
- Code examples provided for each recommendation
- Validation against existing codebase completed
- Performance impact assessed for each recommendation

## Timeline

- **Phase 0 Duration**: 2-3 hours
