# Feature Specification: Enhance NeonPro Coding Standards Through Technology Research

**Feature Branch**: `002-improve-coding-standards-research`\
**Created**: 2025-09-09\
**Status**: Draft\
**Input**: User description: "agora estude a pasta @docs/architecture/ especialmente os arquivos @docs/architecture/source-tree.md e @docs/architecture/tech-stack.md para procurar as docs oficiais das technologias usadas no sistema neonpro para entender as melhores pr√°ticas atrav√©s de uma pesquisa avan√ßada e aprimorar o @docs/rules/coding-standards.md"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extract: Study architecture docs, research official tech docs, enhance coding standards
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Development team, system architects
   ‚Üí Actions: Study, research, enhance documentation
   ‚Üí Data: Architecture documentation, tech stack specifications, coding standards
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must align with current NeonPro technologies
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Research scope defined, enhancement criteria clear
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear workflow: analyze ‚Üí research ‚Üí enhance ‚Üí validate
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities: Documentation files, technology specifications, coding standards
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All aspects clearly defined
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT the development team needs and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement specific coding patterns (those come from research)
- üë• Written for development team leads and architects

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer working on the NeonPro healthcare platform, I need comprehensive coding standards that align with our current technology stack (TanStack Router, Vite, Supabase, etc.) so that I can write consistent, maintainable code that follows industry best practices and ensures healthcare compliance standards.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the current NeonPro tech stack documentation exists, **When** a developer researches official documentation for each technology, **Then** they should find authoritative best practices and coding patterns for each component
2. **Given** enhanced coding standards are created, **When** a developer consults the coding standards document, **Then** they should find specific guidelines for TanStack Router routing patterns, Vite build optimization, React 19 features, and Supabase integration patterns
3. **Given** the enhanced coding standards, **When** applied to healthcare-specific development scenarios, **Then** code should maintain LGPD compliance, healthcare data security, and audit trail requirements

### Edge Cases

- What happens when official documentation conflicts between different technologies?
- How does the system handle technology-specific security requirements in healthcare context?
- How are coding standards maintained when technologies are upgraded?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST analyze current NeonPro architecture documentation to identify all core technologies in use
- **FR-002**: System MUST research official documentation for each identified technology (TanStack Router, Vite, React 19, Supabase, TypeScript, etc.)
- **FR-003**: System MUST extract best practices, coding patterns, and architectural recommendations from official sources
- **FR-004**: System MUST enhance the existing coding standards document with technology-specific guidelines
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure enhanced standards align with healthcare compliance requirements (LGPD, ANVISA)
- **FR-006**: System MUST organize coding standards by technology category (Frontend, Backend, Database, Build Tools)
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide concrete code examples for each standard and best practice
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate enhanced standards against existing NeonPro codebase patterns
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure standards are measurable and enforceable through tooling

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Architecture Documentation**: Contains current system structure, technology choices, and project organization patterns
- **Technology Specifications**: Official documentation sources for each technology used in NeonPro platform
- **Coding Standards Document**: Living document that guides development practices and code quality standards
- **Best Practices Database**: Collected knowledge from official sources about optimal usage patterns for each technology
