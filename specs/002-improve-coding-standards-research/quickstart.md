# Quickstart: Coding Standards Enhancement

**Purpose**: Step-by-step guide to execute the coding standards research and enhancement process\
**Duration**: 3-4 hours total\
**Prerequisites**: Access to NeonPro codebase, Archon MCP, Tavily MCP, Context7 MCP

## Phase 0: Research Execution (90 minutes)

### Step 1: Setup Research Environment

```bash
# Navigate to the specs directory
cd /home/vibecoder/neonpro/specs/002-improve-coding-standards-research

# Verify all required files exist
ls -la  # Should show: spec.md, plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
```

### Step 2: Execute Technology Research

For each technology in the research plan, follow this pattern:

#### 2.1 TanStack Router Research (20 minutes)

```bash
# Use Context7 MCP to research TanStack Router
# Focus on: routing patterns, type-safe navigation, data loading
```

**Research Checklist**:

- [ ] Official documentation reviewed: https://tanstack.com/router/latest
- [ ] Best practices extracted (minimum 3)
- [ ] Code examples collected (TypeScript)
- [ ] Healthcare context applied (audit trails, protected routes)
- [ ] Performance considerations noted

#### 2.2 Vite Research (15 minutes)

**Research Checklist**:

- [ ] Build optimization patterns reviewed
- [ ] Plugin best practices documented
- [ ] Healthcare-specific build requirements noted
- [ ] Performance impact assessed

#### 2.3 React 19 Research (20 minutes)

**Research Checklist**:

- [ ] New React 19 features researched
- [ ] Component patterns updated
- [ ] Healthcare component patterns identified
- [ ] Accessibility patterns documented

#### 2.4 Continue for remaining technologies...

- TypeScript 5.7.2 (15 minutes)
- Supabase (20 minutes - focus on RLS and healthcare compliance)
- shadcn/ui v4 (15 minutes)
- Hono.dev (15 minutes)
- Additional technologies as needed

### Step 3: Consolidate Research Findings

```typescript
// Create research summary structure
interface ResearchSummary {
  totalTechnologies: number
  bestPracticesExtracted: number
  codeExamplesCollected: number
  healthcarePatterns: number
  complianceUpdates: number
}
```

**Validation Checklist**:

- [ ] All 10+ technologies researched
- [ ] Minimum 30 best practices extracted
- [ ] 80%+ practices include code examples
- [ ] Healthcare context applied to all relevant practices
- [ ] Official sources cited for all recommendations

## Phase 1: Enhancement Design (60 minutes)

### Step 4: Analyze Current Coding Standards

```bash
# Read the current coding standards document
cat /home/vibecoder/neonpro/docs/rules/coding-standards.md

# Identify sections that need enhancement
grep -n "## " /home/vibecoder/neonpro/docs/rules/coding-standards.md
```

**Analysis Checklist**:

- [ ] Current structure documented
- [ ] Technology gaps identified
- [ ] Healthcare patterns assessed
- [ ] Update opportunities prioritized

### Step 5: Map Research to Document Sections

Create enhancement plan:

```typescript
interface EnhancementMapping {
  existingSections: {
    'TypeScript Standards': 'enhance-with-5.7.2-features'
    'React & Components Standards': 'add-react-19-patterns'
    'Testing Standards': 'update-vitest-patterns'
  }
  newSections: {
    'TanStack Router Patterns': 'routing-best-practices'
    'Vite Build Optimization': 'build-performance-patterns'
    'Supabase Healthcare Compliance': 'rls-audit-patterns'
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Draft Key Enhancements

Focus on high-impact additions:

#### 6.1 TanStack Router Section

```typescript
// Example enhancement content structure
const routerPatterns = {
  fileBasedRouting: 'Consistent route file naming patterns',
  typesSafety: 'Parameter and search validation patterns',
  dataLoading: 'Optimized data loading with React Query integration',
  healthcareProtection: 'Patient data route protection patterns',
}
```

#### 6.2 Healthcare Compliance Section

```typescript
const compliancePatterns = {
  lgpdCompliance: 'Data consent and retention patterns',
  auditTrails: 'Patient data access logging patterns',
  emergencyHandling: 'Critical healthcare scenario patterns',
  brazilianLocalization: 'PT-BR specific implementation patterns',
}
```

## Phase 2: Implementation and Validation (90 minutes)

### Step 7: Enhance Coding Standards Document

```bash
# Create backup of current standards
cp /home/vibecoder/neonpro/docs/rules/coding-standards.md \
   /home/vibecoder/neonpro/docs/rules/coding-standards.md.backup

# Begin enhancement process
# Use Edit tool to systematically enhance each section
```

**Enhancement Process**:

1. **Preserve existing structure and principles**
2. **Add technology-specific sections**
3. **Integrate healthcare compliance patterns**
4. **Include concrete code examples**
5. **Update version and changelog**

### Step 8: Validate Against Existing Codebase

```bash
# Search for existing patterns to validate compatibility
# Use Serena MCP to analyze current code patterns

# Example validation commands:
grep -r "TanStack" /home/vibecoder/neonpro/apps/web/src/
grep -r "useQuery" /home/vibecoder/neonpro/apps/web/src/
```

**Validation Checklist**:

- [ ] New standards align with existing code patterns
- [ ] No breaking changes introduced without migration guidance
- [ ] Healthcare patterns validated against existing compliance code
- [ ] Performance impact assessed for each new standard
- [ ] TypeScript examples compile successfully

### Step 9: Quality Assurance

```bash
# Run linting and type checking on example code
bun run type-check
bun run lint

# Validate document structure and links
# Check all external links are accessible
```

**Quality Gates**:

- [ ] All code examples are syntactically correct
- [ ] External links verified as accessible
- [ ] Document structure maintained and improved
- [ ] Healthcare compliance patterns complete
- [ ] Implementation guidance provided for all new standards

## Phase 3: Documentation and Delivery (30 minutes)

### Step 10: Create Implementation Guide

Document the changes made:

```markdown
# Coding Standards Enhancement Summary

## Changes Made

- Added TanStack Router patterns section
- Enhanced React 19 component standards
- Updated TypeScript 5.7.2 patterns

- Gradual adoption in new feature development
```

### Step 11: Update Project Documentation

```bash
# Update architecture documentation if needed
# Commit changes with proper versioning
git add docs/rules/coding-standards.md
git commit -m "feat: enhance coding standards with current tech stack patterns

- Add TanStack Router routing patterns
- Update React 19 component standards
