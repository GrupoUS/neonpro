# Tasks: Enhance NeonPro Coding Standards Through Technology Research

**Input**: Design documents from `/home/vibecoder/neonpro/specs/002-improve-coding-standards-research/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✓), research.md (✓), data-model.md (✓), contracts/ (✓), quickstart.md (✓)

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓
   → Tech stack: TypeScript 5.7.2, React 19.1.1, TanStack Router, Vite 5.2.0, Supabase 2.45.1
   → Project type: documentation/research - single project structure
2. Load optional design documents ✓:
   → research.md: 10+ technologies to research with healthcare compliance
   → contracts/: Research and enhancement validation contracts
   → quickstart.md: 3-4 hour execution timeline with validation checklists
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: research environment, validation framework
   → Research: technology-specific research tasks (parallel where possible)
   → Enhancement: document modification and integration
   → Validation: quality gates and compliance verification
   → Polish: finalization and delivery
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different technologies = mark [P] for parallel research
   → Same document section = sequential enhancement
   → Research validation before enhancement (TDD equivalent)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Validate task completeness ✓
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`

## Dependencies

**Research Dependencies**:

- All research (T015-T024) before healthcare integration (T025-T028)

**Enhancement Dependencies**:
- Healthcare integration (T025-T028) before enhancement design (T029-T033)
- Enhancement design (T029-T033) before implementation (T034-T041)
- Implementation (T034-T041) before validation (T042-T047)

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Research Plan**: Each technology → research task [P] (different tech sources)
2. **From Contracts**: Each validation criteria → checklist task [P] (different validation areas)
3. **From Quickstart**: Each phase → grouped implementation tasks
4. **From Data Model**: Each entity type → enhancement task (sequential for same document)

## Validation Checklist

**Research Completeness**:
- [x] All 10+ technologies have research tasks
- [x] All research tasks have validation criteria
- [x] Healthcare compliance integrated throughout
- [x] Official documentation sources specified

**Task Structure**:
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files/technologies)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file paths
- [x] No task modifies same document section as another [P] task
- [x] Research validation before implementation (RDD pattern)

**Enhancement Coverage**:
- [x] All existing document sections have enhancement tasks
- [x] New technology sections planned and tasked
- [x] Healthcare compliance integration points identified
- [x] Backward compatibility validation included

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different technologies/files, no dependencies
- Research validation must pass before enhancement
- Commit after each enhancement phase
- Follow TDD equivalent: Research validation → Research → Enhancement → Validation
- Estimated total time: 3-4 hours as per quickstart guide
- Primary tools: Context7 MCP, Tavily MCP, Serena MCP, Desktop Commander MCP
