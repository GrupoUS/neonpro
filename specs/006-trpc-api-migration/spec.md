# Feature Specification: tRPC API Migration

**Feature Branch**: `006-trpc-api-migration`  
**Created**: 2025-09-18  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Migrate from Hono + Zod validation to tRPC for end-to-end type-safe APIs, evaluating Valibot vs Zod v4 for validation"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Migrate existing Hono + Zod API architecture to tRPC
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Frontend developers, Backend developers, API consumers
   ‚Üí Actions: API calls, data validation, type checking, error handling
   ‚Üí Data: Patient records, appointments, healthcare metrics, user data
   ‚Üí Constraints: Healthcare compliance (LGPD), performance, bundle size
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Validation library choice (Valibot vs Zod v4) - RESEARCHED
   ‚Üí Migration timeline and phases - PLANNING REQUIRED
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Developer experience, API reliability, type safety
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí End-to-end type safety, validation, error handling
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí API routes, validation schemas, type definitions
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Migration strategy defined, compliance maintained
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT developers and API consumers need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no specific tRPC procedures, validation schemas)
- üë• Written for development team and technical stakeholders

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a frontend developer, I want to call backend APIs with full TypeScript type safety so that I can catch type errors at compile time and have confident auto-completion throughout the entire API integration workflow.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a frontend component needs patient data, **When** calling the API, **Then** TypeScript should provide full type safety and auto-completion
2. **Given** an API schema changes, **When** building the frontend, **Then** TypeScript should catch breaking changes at compile time
3. **Given** invalid data is sent to an API, **When** validation occurs, **Then** meaningful error messages should be returned to the client
4. **Given** a healthcare compliance audit, **When** reviewing API interactions, **Then** all patient data validations should be traceable and logged

### Edge Cases
- What happens when API schema versions differ between frontend and backend?
- How does system handle validation errors for complex nested healthcare data?
- How are type definitions maintained across the monorepo packages?
- What happens when network requests fail with tRPC vs current Hono setup?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide end-to-end type safety from frontend to backend APIs
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate all API inputs and outputs using a consistent validation library  
- **FR-003**: Developers MUST be able to generate TypeScript types automatically from API definitions
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility during migration phases
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve all existing API functionality and performance characteristics
- **FR-006**: System MUST support healthcare compliance logging and audit trails for all API calls
- **FR-007**: System MUST integrate seamlessly with TanStack Query for client-side data management
- **FR-008**: System MUST integrate seamlessly with TanStack Router for type-safe routing
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide meaningful error messages for validation failures
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain or improve current API response times
- **FR-011**: System MUST reduce bundle size compared to current Hono + Zod implementation
- **FR-012**: System MUST support real-time subscriptions for healthcare monitoring features

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **tRPC Router**: Central API definition with type-safe procedures and middleware
- **Validation Schemas**: Healthcare-compliant data validation rules for all entities
- **Type Definitions**: Shared types across frontend and backend packages
- **API Procedures**: Individual API endpoints with input/output validation
- **Middleware**: Authentication, logging, and compliance layers
- **Client Configuration**: Frontend tRPC client setup with TanStack integration
