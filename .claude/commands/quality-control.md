  - security-auditor: "LGPD compliance, PHI handling"
  - architect-review: "Appointment system architecture"
  - code-reviewer: "Business logic implementation"
  - test: "Healthcare compliance testing"

workflow: "healthcare-compliance-tdd"
execution: "security-critical with full agent coordination"
```

### Example 2: API Integration Enhancement

```yaml
feature: "external-api-integration"
complexity: "medium"
triggers: ["api", "integration", "external"]

agent_activation:
  - architect-review: "Integration architecture patterns"
  - security-auditor: "API security validation"
  - code-reviewer: "Integration code quality"
  - test: "Integration testing patterns"

workflow: "standard-tdd"
execution: "parallel where possible, sequential for dependencies"
```

## üß© Minimal Examples

Type safety

```ts
// Before
type Handler = (c: any) => any;
// After
type Handler = (c: import('hono').Context) => Response | Promise<Response>;
```

ESM imports

```ts
// Before
const { execSync } = require('node:child_process');
// After
import { execSync } from 'node:child_process';
```

## üß≠ Quick Start (Task Runner)

Use workspace tasks for speed:

- ‚ÄúüèõÔ∏è Constitutional Audit - Quick‚Äù ‚Üí fast compliance validation
- ‚ÄúüèõÔ∏è Constitutional Audit - Full‚Äù ‚Üí exhaustive validation
- ‚Äúüìà Performance Benchmark‚Äù ‚Üí perf checks
- ‚Äúüè• Healthcare Compliance Check‚Äù ‚Üí LGPD/ANVISA heuristics

CLI fallbacks

```bash
# Root helpers
pnpm quality:full
pnpm workflow:ci

# Tools/audit
pnpm constitutional:quick
pnpm constitutional:full
pnpm constitutional:benchmark
```

## This enhanced audit prompt integrates the Quality Control command‚Äôs strengths (testing, compliance, performance, security, cleanup, formatting) into our existing phases‚Äîmapped to NeonPro‚Äôs stack and source tree, without overengineering or redundant rules.

## üî¨ Optional Advanced DB Checks (keep if needed)

Prisma advanced (use only when investigating schema drift):

```bash
# Validate schema against DB (if script exists in packages/database)
cd packages/database && pnpm prisma:validate || npx prisma validate --schema prisma/schema.prisma

# Compare actual DB schema (read‚Äëonly)
cd packages/database && npx prisma db pull --print > schema-actual.prisma

diff packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma schema-actual.prisma || true
```

## üßØ Optional Project-Specific Tests (if available)

```bash
# API route/database integration suites (run if these scripts exist)
cd apps/api && pnpm test:routes || true
cd apps/api && pnpm test:db-integration || true
cd apps/api && pnpm test:lgpd-compliance || true
cd apps/api && pnpm test:rls-security || true
```

## üîç Troubleshooting Agent Orchestration

### Common Orchestration Issues

| Issue                            | Symptoms                                             | Solution                                             | Responsible Agent  |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Agent Coordination Conflicts** | Multiple agents making contradictory recommendations | Implement priority hierarchy and conflict resolution | All agents         |
| **Quality Gate Failures**        | Consistent failures in specific quality gates        | Review gate thresholds and agent effectiveness       | Primary gate agent |
| **Performance Degradation**      | Audit cycles taking significantly longer             | Optimize agent selection and parallel execution      | architect-review   |
| **Context Loss Between Phases**  | Agents losing shared context during transitions      | Strengthen state management and context persistence  | All agents         |
| **Healthcare Compliance Issues** | LGPD or RLS validation failures                      | Enhanced security-auditor focus and validation       | security-auditor   |

### Recovery Strategies

```yaml
recovery_strategies:
  agent_failure:
    - "Automatic failover to backup agent"
    - "Graceful degradation with reduced functionality"
    - "Manual intervention escalation"

  quality_gate_failure:
    - "Detailed failure analysis and reporting"
    - "Suggested remediation steps"
    - "Rollback to last successful state"

  orchestration_failure:
    - "Reset to last known good state"
    - "Re-initialize agent coordination"
    - "Fallback to manual execution mode"
```

## üéØ Summary

**This enhanced multi-agent orchestration system transforms the basic audit into a sophisticated, intelligent quality assurance workflow. It integrates TDD methodology, parallel execution optimization, comprehensive quality gates, and healthcare compliance validation‚Äîall while maintaining compatibility with NeonPro's existing tech stack and development workflows.**
