```

#### **Phase 2: Architecture & Planning**
```yaml
ARCHITECTURE:

  file_structure_planning:
    - "Map required files and directories"
    - "Plan component hierarchy and relationships"
    - "Design configuration and integration points"
    
  quality_framework:
    code_standards: "Apply project-specific linting and formatting rules"
    testing_strategy: "Unit, integration, and e2e testing approach"
    documentation: "API docs, component docs, and usage examples"
```

#### **Phase 3: Implementation with Progressive Quality**
```yaml
IMPLEMENTATION:
  development_approach:
    L1-L3: |
      1. Create core implementation files
      2. Add basic tests and validation
      3. Update documentation
      
    L4-L6: |
      1. Design component architecture
      2. Implement core functionality with error handling
      3. Add comprehensive tests and integration
      4. Update related configurations and docs
      
    L7-L10: |
      1. Create detailed architectural design
      2. Implement core with advanced patterns
      3. Add comprehensive testing suite
      4. Integration testing and validation
      5. Performance optimization
      6. Security review and hardening
      7. Comprehensive documentation
      
  progressive_validation:
    - "Real-time linting and type checking"
    - "Incremental testing execution"
    - "Code review checkpoints"
    - "Integration validation"
```
