## Auto-Activation Triggers
```yaml
bilingual_triggers:
  portuguese: ["entregar", "finalizar", "otimizar", "deployar", "documentar", "transferir"]
  english: ["deliver", "finalize", "optimize", "deploy", "document", "transfer"]
  
workflow_triggers:
  - "Validation phase completed successfully"
  - "Quality certification achieved"

## Execution Pattern

### 1. Delivery Strategy Assessment
```bash
# Load validation results and determine delivery scope
VALIDATION_REPORT=$(cat .claude/.cache/validation/validation-report.md)
COMPLEXITY_LEVEL=$(cat .claude/.cache/context.tmp | grep COMPLEXITY_LEVEL)
QUALITY_ACHIEVEMENT=$(cat .claude/.cache/validation/quality-certification.json)

echo "ðŸš€ Assessing delivery strategy..."

# Determine delivery complexity
case $COMPLEXITY_LEVEL in
    "L1-L2")
        DELIVERY_MODE="simple"
        OPTIMIZATION_DEPTH="basic"
        DOCUMENTATION_LEVEL="essential"
        ;;
    "L3-L4")
        DELIVERY_MODE="standard" 
        OPTIMIZATION_DEPTH="moderate"
        DOCUMENTATION_LEVEL="comprehensive"
        ;;
    "L5-L6")
        DELIVERY_MODE="advanced"
        OPTIMIZATION_DEPTH="thorough"
        DOCUMENTATION_LEVEL="detailed"
        ;;
    "L7-L8")
        DELIVERY_MODE="enterprise"
        OPTIMIZATION_DEPTH="comprehensive"
        DOCUMENTATION_LEVEL="enterprise"
        ;;

        OPTIMIZATION_DEPTH="maximum"
        DOCUMENTATION_LEVEL="mission_critical"
        ;;
esac
```

### 2. Multi-Phase Delivery Process
```bash
echo "ðŸ“¦ Executing comprehensive delivery process..."

# Initialize delivery workspace
DELIVERY_DIR=".claude/.cache/delivery"
mkdir -p "$DELIVERY_DIR"

# Execute delivery phases
execute_final_optimization
prepare_production_deployment
finalize_documentation
setup_monitoring_observability
prepare_knowledge_transfer
generate_delivery_report
