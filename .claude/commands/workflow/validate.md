COMPLEXITY_LEVEL=$(cat .claude/.cache/context.tmp | grep COMPLEXITY_LEVEL)
QUALITY_TARGET=$(cat .claude/.cache/routing.tmp | grep QUALITY_TARGET)

echo "üîç Assessing validation requirements..."

# Determine validation depth based on complexity
case $COMPLEXITY_LEVEL in
    "L1-L2")
        VALIDATION_MODE="basic"
        VALIDATION_DEPTH="essential"
        ;;
    "L3-L4") 
        VALIDATION_MODE="standard"
        VALIDATION_DEPTH="comprehensive"
        ;;
    "L5-L6")
        VALIDATION_MODE="advanced"
