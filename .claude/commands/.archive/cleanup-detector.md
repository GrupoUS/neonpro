# /cleanup - Intelligent Code Cleanup & Deduplication Command

## Command: `/cleanup [scope] [--auto-fix] [--healthcare] [--aggressive] [--paths-only]`

### üéØ **Purpose**
**CLEAN UP CONSTANTLY** implementation with intelligent detection of duplicate, redundant, unused, and obsolete code. Automatic path correction, dead code elimination, and system optimization following NEONPRO's "no backwards compatibility" principle.

### üßπ **Core Cleanup Philosophy**
```yaml
CLEANUP_PRINCIPLES:
  constant_cleaning: "After every task - busque por c√≥digos duplicados/obsoletos"
  path_correction: "Always correct paths to avoid redirection errors"  
  no_backwards_compatibility: "Remove deprecated code immediately"
  detailed_errors: "Detailed errors over graceful failures - identify and fix fast"
  system_optimization: "Keep system clean and organized"
  
CLEANUP_SCOPE:
  duplicate_code: "Identical or near-identical code blocks"
  redundant_functions: "Functions that do the same thing"
  unused_imports: "Import statements not being used"
  obsolete_files: "Files no longer referenced or needed"
  broken_paths: "Incorrect file paths and redirections"
  dead_dependencies: "Unused packages and libraries"
```

### üöÄ **Execution Flow**

#### **Phase 1: Codebase Analysis & Discovery**
```yaml
ANALYSIS_PHASE:
  project_scanning:
    - "Scan entire project structure for patterns"
    - "Identify file types and relationships"
    - "Map import/export dependencies"
    - "Healthcare-specific pattern detection"
    
  duplicate_detection:
    - "AST-based code similarity analysis"
    - "Function signature duplication detection"
    - "Component duplication identification"
    - "Configuration duplication scanning"
    
  path_analysis:
    - "Broken import path detection"
    - "Redirect loop identification"
    - "Relative path optimization opportunities"
    - "Healthcare module path validation"
    
  dependency_mapping:
    - "Unused import detection"
    - "Orphaned file identification"
    - "Dead package dependency scanning"

```

#### **Phase 2: Intelligent Cleanup Classification**
```yaml

    priority: "HIGH - Immediate removal required"
    examples: "Identical utility functions, duplicate components"
    action: "Consolidate into single implementation"
    healthcare: "Medical data processing duplicates"
    
  redundant_patterns:
    priority: "MEDIUM - Optimization opportunity"
    examples: "Similar but not identical implementations"
    action: "Refactor to unified approach"
    healthcare: "Patient workflow redundancies"
    
  obsolete_code:
    priority: "HIGH - Remove immediately"
    examples: "Commented code, unused functions, deprecated APIs"
    action: "Delete without backward compatibility"
    healthcare: "Outdated compliance implementations"
    
  path_corrections:
    priority: "CRITICAL - System stability"
    examples: "Broken imports, incorrect redirects"
    action: "Fix immediately to prevent errors"
    healthcare: "Medical module path corrections"
```

#### **Phase 3: Automated Cleanup Execution**
```yaml
CLEANUP_EXECUTION:
  safe_removal:
    - "Verify no active references before deletion"
    - "Create backup of removed code (temporary)"
    - "Update all dependent imports automatically"
    - "Validate healthcare compliance maintained"
    
  path_correction:
    - "Fix broken import paths automatically"
    - "Update relative to absolute paths where beneficial"
    - "Correct redirect loops and circular dependencies"
    - "Optimize healthcare module imports"
    
  consolidation:
    - "Merge duplicate implementations intelligently"
    - "Preserve best implementation of duplicates"
    - "Update all references to consolidated version"
    - "Maintain healthcare functionality integrity"
```
