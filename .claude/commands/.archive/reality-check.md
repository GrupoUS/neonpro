# /reality-check - 30-Second Reality Check Validation Command

## Command: `/reality-check [scope] [--auto] [--healthcare] [--comprehensive] [--ci-mode]`

### üéØ **Purpose**
**30-Second Reality Check** implementation with comprehensive validation ensuring "Test changes instead of assuming they work". Mandatory quality gate that must answer YES to ALL validation criteria before task completion.

### ‚úÖ **Core Reality Check Philosophy**
```yaml
REALITY_CHECK_PRINCIPLES:
  test_not_assume: "Test changes instead of assuming they work"
  verify_expectations: "Verify outputs match expectations"
  handle_errors_properly: "Handle errors properly"
  follow_complete_checklist: "Follow the complete checklist"
  should_vs_does: "'Should work' ‚â† 'does work' - Pattern matching isn't enough"
  solve_problems: "I'm not paid to write code, I'm paid to solve problems"  
  untested_is_guess: "Untested code is just a guess, not a solution"
  
VALIDATION_GATE:
  mandatory: "Must answer YES to ALL criteria"
  blocking: "Task cannot be marked complete until validation passes"
  comprehensive: "No shortcuts or assumptions allowed"
  healthcare: "Enhanced validation for medical applications"
```
