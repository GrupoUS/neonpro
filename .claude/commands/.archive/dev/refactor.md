    L7-L10: "Complex refactoring - Architectural changes with migration strategy"
    
  refactoring_patterns:
    - "Apply appropriate design patterns for technology stack"
    - "Extract methods, classes, and modules for better separation"
    - "Eliminate code duplication and improve reusability"

  quality_preservation:
    - "Maintain existing functionality and behavior"
    - "Preserve API contracts and public interfaces"
    - "Ensure backward compatibility where required"
    - "Validate performance improvements"
```

#### **Phase 3: Validation & Quality Assurance**
```yaml
VALIDATION:
  comprehensive_testing:
    - "Run existing test suites to verify functionality preservation"
    - "Add new tests for refactored components"
    - "Performance testing to validate improvements"
    - "Integration testing to ensure system stability"
    
  quality_metrics:
    - "Measure code complexity reduction"
    - "Validate maintainability improvements"
    - "Assess performance gains"
    - "Verify security enhancements"
    
  documentation_updates:
    - "Update code documentation and comments"
    - "Revise architectural diagrams and specs"
    - "Document refactoring decisions and rationale"
    - "Update deployment and maintenance guides"
```
