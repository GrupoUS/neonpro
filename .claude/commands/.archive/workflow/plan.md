## Universal Description
**Phase 3: Planning & Design** - Strategic implementation planning with constitutional architecture design for any project complexity and domain.

## Purpose
Transform research insights into comprehensive implementation plans using constitutional AI principles, systematic design thinking, and architecture patterns suitable for any technology stack or business domain.

## Context Detection
- **Architecture Planning**: System design, component structure, data flow
- **Implementation Strategy**: Development approach, technology integration
- **Resource Planning**: Timeline, skills, tools, dependencies
- **Risk Management**: Risk assessment, mitigation strategies, contingency plans
- **Quality Planning**: Quality gates, testing strategy, validation approach
- **Deployment Planning**: Environment setup, CI/CD, monitoring

## Ready for Planning

Constitutional planning system activated. The planning phase will:

‚úÖ **Apply constitutional AI framework** for multi-perspective planning analysis  
‚úÖ **Design system architecture** appropriate for project complexity and requirements  
‚úÖ **Create implementation strategy** with realistic timelines and resource allocation  
‚úÖ **Establish quality framework** with progressive standards and validation gates  
‚úÖ **Assess and mitigate risks** through comprehensive risk management planning  
‚úÖ **Prepare coordination inputs** with clear roles, responsibilities, and workflows  

**Usage**: Type `/plan` or `/planejar` to begin comprehensive planning, or let the system auto-activate after research phase completion for L3+ complexity projects.

The planning phase ensures every implementation has a solid foundation with constitutional principles, quality standards, and comprehensive strategy for optimal project success.
