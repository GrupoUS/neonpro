# Command: /coordinate | /coordenar

## Universal Description
**Phase 4: Coordination & Task Distribution** - Intelligent agent orchestration and task distribution with context preservation for any project complexity.

## Purpose
Orchestrate specialized agents and coordinate task execution based on implementation plan, ensuring optimal agent selection, seamless handoffs, and context preservation throughout the development process.

## Context Detection
- **Multi-Agent Requirements**: Complex tasks requiring specialized expertise
- **Task Distribution**: Breaking down implementation into coordinated workstreams
- **Agent Specialization**: Routing tasks to optimal agent capabilities
- **Context Management**: Preserving context across agent transitions
- **Quality Coordination**: Ensuring consistent quality standards across agents

## Execution Pattern

### 1. Coordination Strategy Assessment
```bash
# Load implementation plan and analyze coordination needs
IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN=$(cat .claude/.cache/implementation-plan.md)
COMPLEXITY_LEVEL=$(cat .claude/.cache/context.tmp | grep COMPLEXITY_LEVEL)
QUALITY_TARGET=$(cat .claude/.cache/routing.tmp | grep QUALITY_TARGET)

echo "ðŸŽ­ Analyzing coordination requirements..."

# Determine coordination complexity
if [[ $COMPLEXITY_LEVEL =~ "L[1-3]" ]]; then
    COORDINATION_MODE="single_agent"
    AGENT_COUNT=1
elif [[ $COMPLEXITY_LEVEL =~ "L[4-5]" ]]; then
    COORDINATION_MODE="dual_agent"
    AGENT_COUNT=2
elif [[ $COMPLEXITY_LEVEL =~ "L[6-7]" ]]; then
    COORDINATION_MODE="multi_agent"
    AGENT_COUNT=3-4
else
    COORDINATION_MODE="orchestrated"
    AGENT_COUNT=4+
fi
```

### 2. Agent Selection Matrix
```bash
# Analyze implementation plan for agent specialization needs
echo "ðŸ¤– Selecting optimal agent configuration..."

REQUIRED_SPECIALIZATIONS=()

# Detect frontend requirements

    REQUIRED_SPECIALIZATIONS+=("apex-ui-ux-designer")
fi

# Detect backend/API requirements  
if grep -q "backend\|api\|server\|database" implementation-plan.md; then
