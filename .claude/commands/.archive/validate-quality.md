  - Audit trail implementation
  - Data encryption for sensitive information
- ✅ **ANVISA Compliance**: Medical device software standards (where applicable)
- ✅ **CFM Compliance**: Digital health regulations adherence
- ✅ **Performance Standards**: <100ms patient data access

### 4. **Test Coverage Review**
- ✅ Unit tests cover edge cases and healthcare scenarios
- ✅ Integration tests for patient data workflows
- ✅ End-to-end tests for critical healthcare paths
- ✅ Security testing for patient data protection
- ✅ Performance testing for clinical operations

### 5. **Active Refactoring & Improvement**
When improvements are needed:
- 🔧 **Make changes directly** in the files
- 📖 **Explain WHY** the change improves healthcare functionality
- 🎯 **Describe HOW** the change enhances patient safety/compliance
- ✅ **Ensure tests pass** after refactoring
- 📝 **Update documentation** for healthcare workflows

### 6. **Security & Performance Review**
- 🛡️ **Security**: OWASP Top 10 + healthcare data protection
- ⚡ **Performance**: Clinical workflow optimization
- 🔐 **Privacy**: Patient data encryption and access control
- 📊 **Monitoring**: Healthcare metrics and alerting

## MCP Integration

- **Desktop-Commander**: Execute tests and file analysis for QA validation
- **Context7**: Validate against official testing and QA documentation
- **Supabase-MCP**: Database testing and compliance validation
- **Exa**: Expert QA patterns and healthcare testing strategies
