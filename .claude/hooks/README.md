# Claude Code Hooks System - Refactored Architecture

## Overview

This directory contains the refactored Claude Code hooks system with shared library architecture,
providing rule enforcement, pattern learning, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

## Architecture - â‰¥9.5/10 Quality Standards

### Shared Library Foundation

- **`.././hook-commons.sh`**: Core shared library providing common functionality
- **Configuration Management**: Reads from `../workflows/` and `../settings.json`
- **Rule Enforcement Engine**: Validates tool usage against configured rules
- **Pattern Integration**: Learns from successful operations and applies patterns
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks execution time and system resources

### Hook Files (Refactored)

#### 1. `pre-tool-use.sh` - Critical Validation Hook

- **Execution**: Before each tool call (CAN BLOCK execution)
- **Functionality**:
  - Rule enforcement and security validation
  - Quality standards checking (minimum 9.0/10)
  - Pattern compliance verification
  - Security validation for sensitive operations
- **Integration**: Full `.claude` directory configuration integration

#### 2. `post-tool-use.sh` - Learning and Analysis Hook

- **Execution**: After each tool call
- **Functionality**:
  - Result analysis and pattern learning
  - Quality and performance tracking
  - Success pattern recording
  - Configuration updates based on results
- **Integration**: Updates learned patterns and tracks quality metrics

#### 3. `stop.sh` - Session Management Hook

- **Execution**: When Claude Code session stops
- **Functionality**:
  - Session analysis and reporting
  - Performance metrics analysis
  - Cleanup and maintenance tasks
  - Pattern learning finalization
- **Integration**: Comprehensive session cleanup and archival

#### 4. `subagent-stop.sh` - Agent Coordination Hook

- **Execution**: When a subagent stops
- **Functionality**:
  - Agent coordination tracking
  - Handoff validation and management
  - Agent-specific performance analysis
  - Coordination reporting for orchestrator
- **Integration**: Full orchestrator-worker pattern support

â”œâ”€â”€ pre-tool-use.log         # Pre-tool validation logs
â”œâ”€â”€ post-tool-use.log        # Post-tool analysis logs  
â”œâ”€â”€ stop.log                 # Session stop logs
â”œâ”€â”€ subagent-stop.log        # Agent coordination logs
â”œâ”€â”€ performance.csv          # Performance metrics (CSV format)
â”œâ”€â”€ quality-tracking.log     # Quality metrics tracking
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/                  # Agent-specific logs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ apex-dev.log
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ apex-researcher.log
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ session-summary-*.log    # Session summary reports
```

### Cache Structure

```
../.cache/
â”œâ”€â”€ successful_patterns.log     # Successful operation patterns
â”œâ”€â”€ successful_handoffs.log     # Successful agent handoffs
â”œâ”€â”€ partial_handoffs.log        # Partial handoff tracking
â”œâ”€â”€ failed_handoffs.log         # Failed handoff analysis
â”œâ”€â”€ agent_timing_patterns.log   # Agent timing patterns
â””â”€â”€ *.tmp                       # Temporary files (auto-cleaned)
```

## Usage Examples

### Manual Hook Execution

```bash
# Test pre-tool-use validation
./pre-tool-use.sh "mcp__desktop-commander__write_file" "test_args"

# Test post-tool-use analysis  
./post-tool-use.sh "mcp__context7__get-library-docs" "success" "test_args"

# Test session stop
./stop.sh "session_123" "normal"

# Test subagent coordination
./subagent-stop.sh "apex-dev" "agent_456" "normal" "completed"
```

### Configuration Examples

```bash
# Check minimum quality setting
source .././hook-commons.sh
MIN_QUALITY=$(get_config_value "workflows/core-workflow.md" "minimum_quality" "9.0")
echo "Minimum quality standard: $MIN_QUALITY"

# Enable security validation
SECURITY_ENABLED=$(get_config_value "workflows/core-workflow.md" "security_validation" "true")
```

## Quality Standards - â‰¥9.5/10 Implementation

### Code Quality

- âœ… Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation
- âœ… Cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Unix path handling)
- âœ… Performance optimization (caching, efficient algorithms)
- âœ… Security-first design with input validation
- âœ… Comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Architecture Excellence

- âœ… Shared library pattern for code reuse and maintainability
- âœ… Configuration-driven behavior with hot-reload capability
- âœ… Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- âœ… Scalable architecture supporting future enhancements
- âœ… Integration with existing `.claude` directory structure

### Operational Excellence

- âœ… Automatic cleanup and maintenance
- âœ… Performance monitoring and optimization
- âœ… Comprehensive logging and audit trail
- âœ… Pattern learning and continuous improvement
- âœ… Production-ready reliability and error handling

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Shared library not found**: Ensure `.././hook-commons.sh` exists and is executable
2. **Permission issues**: Ensure hooks have execute permissions (`chmod +x *.sh`)
3. **Configuration errors**: Check `../workflows/` configuration files for syntax
4. **Performance issues**: Review `../logs/performance.csv` for bottlenecks

### Debug Mode

Set `HOOK_DEBUG=1` environment variable for verbose logging:

```bash
export HOOK_DEBUG=1
./pre-tool-use.sh "test_tool"
```

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time configuration updates without restart
- Machine learning integration for advanced pattern recognition
- API integration for external monitoring systems
- Advanced security features (intrusion detection, anomaly detection)
- Multi-language support for hook scripts (Python, JavaScript)
