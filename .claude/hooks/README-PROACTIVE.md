## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration System

### Main Configuration File (`hook-config.json`)

The heart of the proactive system is the `hook-config.json` file that defines what commands to run and when:

```json
{
  "taskCompletionCommands": {
    "always": [/* Commands that always run after task completion */],
    "onSuccess": [/* Commands for successful task completion */],
    "onFailure": [/* Commands for failed task completion */]
  },
  "planCompletionCommands": {
    "always": [/* Commands that always run after plan completion */],
    "onSuccess": [/* Commands for successful plan completion */],
    "onFailure": [/* Commands for failed plan completion */]
  }
}
```

### Settings Integration (`settings.local.json`)

Enhanced hook configuration in Claude Code settings:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [/* Pre-execution hooks with retry logic */],
    "PostToolUse": [/* Post-execution hooks with plan tracking */],
    "SubagentStop": [/* Task completion hooks with proactive commands */],
    "Stop": [/* Session completion hooks */]
  },
  "hookConfiguration": {
    "enableProactiveCommands": true,
    "enablePlanTracking": true,
    "enableErrorRecovery": true,
    "maxRetries": 3,
    "defaultTimeout": 60
  }
}
```

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Choose Your Workflow
Select from our pre-built workflow examples:
- **Simple Workflow**: Basic linting and testing
- **Development Workflow**: Comprehensive quality checks
- **Deployment Workflow**: Production deployment pipeline
- **Testing Workflow**: Comprehensive test automation

```bash
# Copy a workflow example
cp .claude/hooks/examples/development-workflow.json .claude/hooks/hook-config.json
```

### Step 2: Verify Your Environment
Ensure you have the required tools:
```bash
# Check Node.js (required for advanced state management)
node --version

# Check npm (for most workflows)
npm --version

# Check git (for version control integration)
git --version
```

### Step 3: Configure Your Scripts
Add the required scripts to your `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint src/ --fix",
    "test": "jest --coverage",
    "build": "webpack --mode=production"
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Test the System
1. Start a Claude Code session
2. Use TodoWrite to create a plan with multiple tasks
3. Complete tasks and watch the proactive commands execute automatically
4. Check `.claude/hooks/claude-hooks.log` for execution details

## üíª Usage Examples

### Basic Development Workflow

When you complete a development task, the system automatically:
1. **Runs ESLint** to check code quality
2. **Executes tests** to ensure functionality
3. **Performs type checking** (if TypeScript)
4. **Provides success/failure feedback**

When your entire plan completes, the system automatically:
1. **Creates a production build**
2. **Generates test coverage reports**
3. **Runs comprehensive quality checks**
4. **Notifies you of completion status**

### Advanced Deployment Workflow

For production deployments, the system provides:
1. **Security audits** before any deployment
2. **Staging deployment** with smoke tests
3. **Production deployment** with health checks
4. **Automatic rollback** on failure detection
5. **Comprehensive monitoring** and alerting

### Example Session Flow

```
1. User creates TodoWrite with development tasks
   ‚Üí Pre-Tool-Use: Initializes plan tracking
   
2. User completes first task (e.g., implement feature)
   ‚Üí Subagent-Stop: Runs lint + tests automatically
   
3. User completes second task (e.g., write tests)
   ‚Üí Subagent-Stop: Runs quality checks automatically
   
4. All todos completed, plan finished
   ‚Üí Post-Tool-Use: Detects completion, runs build automatically
   
5. Session ends
   ‚Üí Session-Stop: Generates summary, archives data
```

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom Command Configuration

```json
{
  "command": "npm",
  "args": ["run", "custom-script"],
  "timeout": 120,
  "continueOnFailure": false,
  "description": "Custom script description",
  "conditions": {
    "fileExists": "package.json",
    "scriptExists": "custom-script",
    "previousCommandSuccess": true
  },
  "environment": {
    "NODE_ENV": "production",
    "CUSTOM_VAR": "value"
  }
}
```

### Conditional Execution

Commands can have conditions that determine when they run:
- **fileExists**: Only run if specific file exists
- **scriptExists**: Only run if npm script exists
- **previousCommandSuccess**: Only run if previous command succeeded
- **environmentVariable**: Check environment variable values

### Error Handling Strategies

Configure how the system handles failures:
```json
{
  "errorHandling": {
    "stopOnFirstFailure": false,
    "notifyOnFailure": true,
    "maxRetries": 3,
    "retryDelay": 2000,
    "fallbackCommands": [
      {
        "command": "echo",
        "args": ["Fallback: Primary command failed"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## üìä Plan Completion Detection

### How It Works

The system uses multiple indicators to detect plan completion:
1. **Todo Activity Monitoring**: Tracks TodoWrite usage patterns
2. **Tool Usage Analysis**: Identifies completion-indicating tools
3. **Task Progression Tracking**: Monitors subagent completion rates
4. **Build/Test Pattern Recognition**: Detects final workflow steps
5. **Inactivity Detection**: Identifies when work has stopped

### Completion Criteria

A plan is considered complete when at least 3 of these conditions are met:
- All tracked tasks have completed
- No TodoWrite activity for specified period
- Build/test commands have been executed
- All active subagents have finished
- File writing activity has ceased

### Customizing Detection

```json
{
  "planCompletionDetection": {
    "enabled": true,
    "inactivityTimeout": 300,
    "minimumCompletionIndicators": 3,
    "toolPatterns": [
      "npm.*build",
      "npm.*test",
      "deploy"
    ]
  }
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling & Recovery

### Error Severity Levels

1. **Minor (Level 1)**: Simple retry with short delay
2. **Moderate (Level 2-3)**: Retry with exponential backoff, fallback commands
3. **Critical (Level 4+)**: Emergency recovery, system reset, notifications

### Recovery Strategies

- **Simple Retry**: For transient failures
- **Exponential Backoff**: For resource-related issues
- **Fallback Commands**: Alternative commands when primary fails
- **System Reset**: Clean slate recovery for critical failures
- **Emergency Stop**: Halt all hook activity if necessary

### Monitoring & Alerting

The error handling system provides:
- Real-time error tracking and classification
- System health monitoring and reporting
- Performance metrics and bottleneck identification
- Automatic recovery execution and verification

## üìù Logging & Monitoring

### Log Files

- **`claude-hooks.log`**: Main execution log with all hook activity
- **`error-log.txt`**: Detailed error information and stack traces
- **`recovery-log.txt`**: Recovery attempt logs and outcomes
- **`system-health.txt`**: System health metrics and monitoring data
- **`tool-usage.log`**: Tool execution tracking and patterns
- **`plan-timeline.log`**: Complete timeline of plan execution

### Log Analysis

```bash
# View recent hook activity
tail -f .claude/hooks/claude-hooks.log

# Check for errors
grep "ERROR" .claude/hooks/error-log.txt

# Monitor plan progression
tail -f .claude/hooks/.cache/plan-timeline.log

# View performance metrics
cat .claude/hooks/.cache/hook-performance.log
```

### State Inspection

```bash
# Check current plan state
node .claude/hooks/plan-state-manager.js load

# View plan summary
node .claude/hooks/plan-state-manager.js summary

# Check completion status
node .claude/hooks/plan-state-manager.js check-completion
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. Commands Don't Execute
**Problem**: Hook system is active but commands don't run
**Solutions**:
- Verify `hook-config.json` exists and is valid JSON
- Check that required npm scripts exist in `package.json`
- Ensure Node.js is available in PATH
- Check `claude-hooks.log` for error messages

#### 2. Plan Completion Never Detected
**Problem**: Individual tasks work but plan completion doesn't trigger
**Solutions**:
- Ensure you're using TodoWrite to create plans
- Check plan state with `plan-state-manager.js summary`
- Verify completion detection settings in configuration
- Look for plan tracking logs in `.cache/plan-timeline.log`

#### 3. Commands Take Too Long
**Problem**: Hook execution is slow or times out
**Solutions**:
- Increase timeout values in hook configurations
- Enable parallel execution where possible
- Optimize npm scripts for speed
- Use `continueOnFailure: true` for non-critical commands

#### 4. Error Recovery Not Working
**Problem**: Failures aren't handled gracefully
**Solutions**:
- Check error handler configuration
- Verify retry settings and fallback commands
- Ensure error thresholds are appropriate
- Review error classification in `error-log.txt`

#### 5. State Management Issues
**Problem**: Plan state becomes corrupted or inconsistent
**Solutions**:
- Use state manager reset: `plan-state-manager.js reset`
- Check for Node.js availability and permissions
- Verify `.cache` directory is writable
- Review state backups in `.cache/state-backups/`

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging for troubleshooting:
```bash
# Windows
set HOOK_DEBUG=1

# Then run Claude Code and check detailed logs
```

### System Health Check

```bash
# Run comprehensive system health check
.claude/hooks/error-handler.bat health-check

# Reset system to safe state if needed
.claude/hooks/error-handler.bat reset
```

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Best Practices

1. **Optimize Command Timeouts**: Set realistic timeouts for each command
2. **Use Conditional Execution**: Avoid running unnecessary commands
3. **Enable Parallel Processing**: Where safe, run commands concurrently
4. **Implement Smart Caching**: Cache build outputs and test results
5. **Monitor Resource Usage**: Track memory and CPU consumption

### Performance Metrics

The system tracks:
- Hook execution times
- Command success/failure rates
- Plan completion detection accuracy
- Resource usage patterns
- Error recovery effectiveness
