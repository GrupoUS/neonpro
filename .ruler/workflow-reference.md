# 🌟 Workflow Reference

**For complete workflow execution, see:**

## 🔄 Master Workflow
- **Complete Framework**: [`core-workflow.md`](../.claude/workflows/core-workflow.md)
- **VIBECODER Integration**: Think → Research → Decompose → Plan → Implement → Validate

## 🎯 Core Principles
- **ARCHON-FIRST**: Always use Archon MCP for task management
- **Constitutional Thinking**: Multi-perspective analysis (Technical, Security, User, Future, Ethics)
- **AI-First Development**: Native AI integration across all layers
- **Progressive Quality**: L1-L10 standards with domain-specific overrides

## 📋 Execution Phases
1. **Discovery & Analysis** - Sequential thinking + complexity assessment
2. **Research First** - Archon → Context7 → Tavily → Exa chain
3. **Planning & Design** - Constitutional service patterns
4. **Implementation** - Agent coordination + streaming optimization
5. **Quality Validation** - ≥9.8/10 standards + compliance verification
