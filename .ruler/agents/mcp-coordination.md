# üîß MCP COORDINATION & TOOL SELECTION - Version: 1.0.0

## Purpose & Scope

This document defines the comprehensive framework for coordinating Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers in AI-assisted development workflows. It establishes mandatory usage patterns, selection criteria, coordination workflows, and error recovery protocols for optimal development efficiency and quality.

## Implementation Guidelines

### **MANDATORY MCP Workflow**

```yaml
MANDATORY_SEQUENCE:
  step_1: "sequential-thinking (ALWAYS FIRST - problem decomposition)"
  step_2: "archon (task management and knowledge base)"
  step_3: "serena (codebase analysis - NEVER use native search)"

CONSTITUTIONAL_RULE: "Never skip mandatory MCPs or use native alternatives"
QUALITY_GATE: "Each mandatory MCP must complete successfully before proceeding"
```

### **MCP Selection Decision Tree**

```yaml
DECISION_MATRIX:
  problem_analysis:
    complexity_level_1-3: "sequential-thinking only"
    complexity_level_4-6: "sequential-thinking ‚Üí archon ‚Üí serena"
    complexity_level_7-10: "sequential-thinking ‚Üí archon ‚Üí context7 ‚Üí serena"

  task_type:
    research_heavy: "sequential-thinking ‚Üí archon ‚Üí context7 ‚Üí tavily"
    implementation_focused: "sequential-thinking ‚Üí archon ‚Üí serena ‚Üí desktop-commander"
    ui_development: "sequential-thinking ‚Üí archon ‚Üí serena ‚Üí shadcn-ui ‚Üí desktop-commander"
    data_analysis: "sequential-thinking ‚Üí desktop-commander (with Python/analysis tools)"

  information_needs:
    framework_documentation: "context7 (resolve-library-id ‚Üí get-library-docs)"
    current_trends: "tavily (search ‚Üí searchContext ‚Üí extract)"
    codebase_understanding: "serena (get_symbols_overview ‚Üí find_symbol ‚Üí find_referencing_symbols)"
    project_context: "archon (perform_rag_query ‚Üí get_project ‚Üí list_tasks)"
```

### **üîó MCP Coordination Workflows**

#### **üî¨ Research-Driven Development Chain**
```yaml
sequence: "sequential-thinking ‚Üí archon ‚Üí context7 ‚Üí tavily ‚Üí serena ‚Üí desktop-commander"
purpose: "Evidence-based implementation with multi-source validation"
use_cases: ["New framework integration", "Complex feature development", "Architecture decisions"]
quality_gate: "‚â•95% research confidence before implementation"
```

#### **‚ö° Rapid Implementation Chain**
```yaml
sequence: "sequential-thinking ‚Üí archon ‚Üí serena ‚Üí desktop-commander"
purpose: "Fast implementation of well-understood requirements"
use_cases: ["Bug fixes", "Simple features", "Code refactoring"]
quality_gate: "Clear requirements and existing patterns identified"
```

#### **üé® UI Development Chain**
```yaml
sequence: "sequential-thinking ‚Üí archon ‚Üí serena ‚Üí shadcn-ui ‚Üí desktop-commander"
purpose: "Healthcare-optimized UI development with accessibility"
use_cases: ["Component creation", "UI refactoring", "Design system updates"]
quality_gate: "WCAG 2.1 AA+ compliance and component integration verified"
```

#### **üìä Data Analysis Chain**
```yaml
sequence: "sequential-thinking ‚Üí desktop-commander (Python REPL) ‚Üí archon (documentation)"
purpose: "File-based data analysis and processing"
use_cases: ["CSV analysis", "Log processing", "Performance metrics"]
quality_gate: "Analysis results validated and documented"
```

### **üö® Error Recovery & Troubleshooting Protocols**

```yaml
RECOVERY_PROTOCOLS:
  mcp_failure:
    step_1: "Document the specific error and context"
    step_2: "Try alternative MCP if available (e.g., tavily if context7 fails)"
    step_3: "Use sequential-thinking to analyze the problem"
    step_4: "Consult archon knowledge base for similar issues"
    step_5: "If stuck >3 attempts, initiate new research cycle"

  infinite_loops:
    detection: "Same MCP called >3 times with similar parameters"
    action: "Stop current approach, use sequential-thinking to reassess"
    alternative: "Switch to different MCP or break down problem further"

  context_loss:
    prevention: "Always maintain context across MCP transitions"
    recovery: "Use archon to retrieve project context and serena for codebase state"
    validation: "Verify context completeness before proceeding"
```

## Examples

### ‚úÖ DO: Proper MCP Coordination
```yaml
# Complex Feature Implementation
1. sequential-thinking: "Break down OAuth2 implementation requirements"
2. archon: "Check existing auth patterns and create implementation tasks"
3. context7: "Research OAuth2 best practices and security patterns"
4. serena: "Analyze current auth codebase structure"
5. desktop-commander: "Implement OAuth2 provider integration"
```

### ‚ùå DON'T: Improper MCP Usage
```yaml
# Wrong approach - skipping mandatory sequence
1. context7: "Research OAuth2" # Missing sequential-thinking first
2. codebase-retrieval: "Find auth files" # Should use serena instead
3. desktop-commander: "Write OAuth2 code" # Missing archon task management
```

## Edge Cases & Exceptions

- **Simple Tasks (complexity ‚â§3)**: May use only sequential-thinking if requirements are crystal clear
- **Emergency Fixes**: May skip archon task management for critical production issues
- **Data Analysis Only**: May use desktop-commander directly for pure data processing tasks

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] Mandatory MCP sequence followed for complex tasks (‚â•4 complexity)
- [ ] serena used instead of native codebase-retrieval in 100% of cases
- [ ] archon task management integrated for all project work
- [ ] Error recovery protocols applied when MCPs fail >3 times
- [ ] Context maintained across all MCP transitions

## Dependencies & Relationships

- **Requires**: Constitutional principles (KISS/YAGNI/CoT) from workflow.md
- **Enhances**: All development workflow phases
- **Conflicts**: Native tool usage (codebase-retrieval, native search)
