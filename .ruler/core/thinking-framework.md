## üéØ INTELLIGENT COMPLEXITY DETECTION

### Automatic Detection Algorithm

The system analyzes multiple factors to determine appropriate thinking level:

**1. Lexical Analysis**

```javascript
// Keyword-based complexity scoring
const complexityKeywords = {
  L1: ['fix', 'update', 'simple', 'basic'],
  L3: ['implement', 'create', 'modify', 'integrate'],
  L5: ['architecture', 'design', 'optimize', 'complex'],
  L7: ['enterprise', 'critical', 'production', 'security'],
  L9: ['healthcare', 'compliance', 'mission-critical', 'regulatory'],
};
```

**2. Context Analysis**

- File count and scope of changes
- Dependencies and integration points
- Domain-specific indicators
- Historical complexity patterns

**3. Domain Enhancement Overrides**

#### Healthcare Domain (Auto-Upgrade to ULTRATHINK)

```yaml
triggers:
  english: ["LGPD", "HIPAA", "patient", "medical", "healthcare", "clinic", "treatment"]
  portuguese: ["LGPD", "paciente", "m√©dico", "sa√∫de", "cl√≠nica", "tratamento"]
quality_override: "‚â•9.9/10 regardless of base complexity"
reasoning: "Healthcare data requires maximum scrutiny for compliance and safety"
```

#### Enterprise Domain (Auto-Upgrade to MEGATHINK)

```yaml
triggers:
  english: ["enterprise", "production", "scalability", "architecture", "security"]
  portuguese: ["empresa", "produ√ß√£o", "escalabilidade", "arquitetura", "seguran√ßa"]
quality_override: "‚â•9.7/10 minimum"
reasoning: "Enterprise systems require robust architecture and reliability"
```

## üîÑ DYNAMIC THINKING ESCALATION

### Escalation Triggers

**Automatic Escalation Conditions**:

1. **Complexity Discovery**: When simple task reveals complex dependencies
2. **Error Patterns**: Repeated failures indicate need for deeper analysis
3. **Domain Triggers**: Healthcare/enterprise keywords detected
4. **Integration Scope**: Multiple systems or services involved
5. **Compliance Requirements**: Regulatory or security implications identified

**Escalation Flow**:

```
THINK ‚Üí Problem complexity detected ‚Üí MEGATHINK
MEGATHINK ‚Üí Healthcare/Critical domain ‚Üí ULTRATHINK
Any Level ‚Üí Compliance keywords ‚Üí ULTRATHINK (MANDATORY)
```

### De-escalation Prevention

**Never De-escalate When**:

- Healthcare/medical data involved
- Financial/payment processing
- Authentication/security systems
- Production deployment
- Regulatory compliance requirements

## üõ† IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

### For AI Coding Assistants

**Automatic Activation**:

1. Parse user request for complexity indicators
2. Scan for domain-specific triggers
3. Determine base complexity level (L1-L10)
4. Apply domain enhancement overrides
5. Select appropriate thinking framework
6. Execute with quality standards

**Manual Override Commands**:

```
User: "think about this..." ‚Üí THINK (4000 tokens)
User: "think deeply about..." ‚Üí MEGATHINK (10000 tokens)  
User: "think critically about..." ‚Üí ULTRATHINK (31999 tokens)
User: "pensar profundamente sobre..." ‚Üí MEGATHINK (Portuguese)
```

### Quality Assurance Integration

**Thinking Level Validation**:

- Verify thinking depth matches complexity
- Ensure domain overrides are applied
- Validate quality standards achieved
- Confirm compliance requirements met

**Feedback Loop**:

- Monitor thinking effectiveness
- Adjust triggers based on outcomes
- Refine complexity detection
- Update domain patterns

## üìà PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

### Token Efficiency

- **Minimum Viable Thinking**: Start with appropriate level, don't over-think simple problems
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Escalate only when complexity discovered
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain thinking context across interactions
- **Pattern Learning**: Improve detection accuracy over time

### Quality Consistency

- **Standard Validation**: Same quality checks regardless of thinking level
- **Progressive Standards**: Higher levels enforce stricter requirements
- **Domain Compliance**: Automatic compliance validation for regulated domains
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Track quality outcomes by thinking level
