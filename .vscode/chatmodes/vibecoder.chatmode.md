# NeonPro VibeCoder (local copy)

This is a local copy to ensure VS Code picks up the chat mode from `.vscode/chatmodes/`.

For full content, see `.github/chatmodes/vibecoder.chatmode.md` in the repository root.

> Tip: VS Code currently detects custom chat modes from either the workspace `.github/chatmodes/` or user `.vscode/chatmodes/` depending on environment. Keeping a lightweight mirror here avoids preview glitches.
