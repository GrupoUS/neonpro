## üö® Emergency Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Actions

1. **Assess the Situation**
   - Identify the scope and impact of the issue
   - Determine if rollback is necessary
   - Document the reason for rollback

2. **Execute Emergency Rollback**

   ```bash
   # Full rollback (production)
   ./scripts/emergency-rollback.sh production "Critical bug causing data corruption" full

   # Partial rollback (configuration only)
   ./scripts/emergency-rollback.sh production "Configuration issue" partial

   # Test rollback (dry run)
   ./scripts/emergency-rollback.sh test "Testing rollback procedure" full
   ```

3. **Post-Rollback Verification**
   - Run health checks: `./scripts/deployment-health-check.sh`
   - Validate compliance: `./scripts/healthcare-compliance-validation.sh`
   - Verify data integrity
   - Monitor system stability

### Rollback Types

| Type        | Description                  | Use Case                           | Downtime     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Full        | Complete deployment rollback | Critical bugs, data corruption     | 5-15 minutes |
| Partial     | Component-specific rollback  | Configuration issues, feature bugs | 2-5 minutes  |
| Config-only | Configuration rollback       | Environment variables, settings    | 1-2 minutes  |

## üíæ Backup Strategies

```bash
# Manual database backup
pg_dump "$DATABASE_URL" | gzip > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql.gz

# Restore from backup
gunzip -c backup-20250922.sql.gz | psql "$DATABASE_URL"
