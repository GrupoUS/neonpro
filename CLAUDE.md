## Core Principles

```yaml
CORE_STANDARDS:
  mantra: "Think â†’ Research â†’ Plan â†’ Decompose with atomic tasks â†’ Implement â†’ Validate"
  mission: "Research first, think systematically, implement flawlessly with cognitive intelligence"
  research_driven: "Multi-source validation for all complex implementations"
  vibecoder_integration: "Constitutional excellence with one-shot resolution philosophy"
  core_principle: "Simple systems that work over complex systems that don't"
  preserve_context: "Maintain complete context across all agent and thinking transitions"
  incorporate_always: "Incorporate what we already have, avoid creating new files, enhance the existing structure"
  always_audit: "Never assume the error is fixed, always audit and validate"
  COGNITIVE_ARCHITECTURE:
  meta_cognition: "Think about the thinking process, identify biases, apply constitutional analysis"
  multi_perspective_analysis:
    - "user_perspective: Understanding user intent and constraints"
    - "developer_perspective: Technical implementation and architecture considerations"
    - "business_perspective: Cost, timeline, and stakeholder impact analysis"
    - "security_perspective: Risk assessment and compliance requirements"
    - "quality_perspective: Standards enforcement and continuous improvement"
```

### Development Philosophy

**Mantra**: _"Think â†’ Research â†’ Decompose â†’ Plan â†’ Implement â†’ Validate"_

**KISS Principle**: Choose the simplest solution that meets requirements. Prioritize readable code over clever optimizations. Reduce cognitive load and avoid over-engineering.

**YAGNI Principle**: Build only what requirements specify. Resist "just in case" features. Refactor when requirements emerge. Focus on current user stories and remove unused, redundant and dead code immediately.

**Chain of Thought**: Break problems into sequential steps and atomic subtasks. Verbalize reasoning process. Show intermediate decisions. Validate against requirements.

### A.P.T.E Methodology

**Analyze** â†’ Comprehensive requirements analysis
**Plan** â†’ Strategic implementation planning
**Think** â†’ Metacognition and multi-perspective evaluation
**Execute** â†’ Systematic implementation with quality gates

**Quality Standard**: â‰¥9.5/10 rating on all deliveries

### Documentation Research Protocol

**MANDATORY STEPS** before executing any CLI command:

1. **Context7 MCP Research**:
   ```typescript
   // Example research query structure
   search_documentation({
     query: 'service_name CLI command_type best_practices project_context',
     sources: ['official_docs', 'github_issues', 'community_guides'],
   })
   ```

2. **Compatibility Verification**:
   - Confirm command works with Bun runtime
   - Verify TypeScript 5.9+ compatibility
   - Check monorepo structure support
   - Validate healthcare compliance requirements

3. **Prerequisites Check**:
   - Authentication status verified
   - Required environment variables set
   - Project configuration files present
   - Dependencies installed and up-to-date

4. **Command Documentation**:
   - Document command pattern in this file
   - Add to project runbook if recurring
   - Include error handling procedures
   - Note any project-specific modifications

### Error Handling Procedures

**CLI Command Failure Protocol**:

```yaml
step_1_capture:
  action: "Capture full error output including exit code"
  tool: "Desktop Commander MCP with error logging"

step_2_research:
  action: "Research error via Context7 MCP"
  query_pattern: "service_name CLI error_message troubleshooting"

step_3_verify:
  checks:
    - "Authentication status valid"
    - "Configuration files correct"
    - "Environment variables set"
    - "Network connectivity available"

step_4_fallback:
  options:
    - "Try alternative CLI flag/option"
    - "Check service status page"
    - "Verify API rate limits"
    - "Review recent service updates"

step_5_document:
  action: "Document error and resolution in project knowledge base"
  location: "docs/troubleshooting/cli-errors.md"
```

### CLI Execution Standards

**Desktop Commander MCP Integration**:

```yaml
execution_requirements:
  tool: "Desktop Commander MCP (MANDATORY)"
  working_directory: "/home/vibecode/neonpro"
  shell: "bash"
  timeout: "30s (default), 300s (long operations)"

logging:
  level: "INFO"
  capture_stdout: true
  capture_stderr: true
  audit_trail: true

error_handling:
  retry_count: 3
  retry_delay: "5s"
  fallback_strategy: "documented"
```

**Command Validation**:

```yaml
pre_execution:
  - "Verify CLI tool installed and accessible"
  - "Confirm authentication status"
  - "Validate command syntax via Context7 MCP"
  - "Check for breaking changes in CLI version"

post_execution:
  - "Verify command success via exit code"
  - "Validate expected output/side effects"
  - "Update project state documentation"
  - "Log operation in audit trail"
```

### Integration Examples

**Example 1: Deploy Supabase Migration**

```bash
# 1. Research (Context7 MCP)
search_documentation("Supabase CLI migration deployment production best practices")

# 2. Create migration
supabase migration new add_patient_consent_tracking

# 3. Apply locally first
supabase db reset
supabase db push

# 4. Generate types
supabase gen types typescript --local > packages/database/src/types/supabase.ts

# 5. Deploy to production
supabase db push --linked

# 6. Verify
supabase migration list
```

**Example 2: Vercel Production Deployment**

```bash
# 1. Research (Context7 MCP)
search_documentation("Vercel CLI production deployment Turborepo monorepo")

# 2. Build locally first
bun turbo run build

# 3. Deploy to production
vercel --prod --cwd apps/web

# 4. Verify deployment
vercel inspect $(vercel ls --prod | head -n 1)

# 5. Check logs
vercel logs --prod --follow
```

### Prohibited Practices

**MUST NOT**:

- Use web UIs for operations that have CLI equivalents
- Make direct API calls when CLI tools are available
- Manually edit configuration files managed by CLIs
- Skip Context7 MCP research for unfamiliar commands
- Execute CLI commands outside Desktop Commander MCP
- Proceed with <90% confidence in command correctness

**MUST ALWAYS**:

- Research command syntax via Context7 MCP first
- Execute all CLI operations via Desktop Commander MCP
- Verify command success and side effects
- Document new command patterns in this file
- Update audit trails for all service operations
- Maintain authentication status across sessions

## Project Restrictions

### MUST Requirements

- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript mode, no any types
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 90% for critical components
- **Security**: Zero vulnerabilities in production builds
- **Performance**: All SLOs must be met or exceeded

### MUST NOT Violations

- **Data Protection**: Never expose patient data without encryption
- **Authentication**: Never bypass security controls
- **Compliance**: Never deploy without healthcare validation
- **Performance**: Never degrade Core Web Vitals below targets
- **Documentation**: Never commit without proper documentation

### Quality Gates

All code changes must pass:

1. **Automated Tests**: 100% pass rate
2. **Type Checking**: Zero TypeScript errors
3. **Security Scan**: Zero high-severity vulnerabilities
4. **Performance**: No regression in Core Web Vitals

---

## Constitutional Authority

This document serves as the ultimate authority for NeonPro project development. All architectural decisions, technology choices, and development practices must align with these constitutional principles.

**Validation Requirements**: Any deviation from these standards requires explicit project leadership approval and documentation of the technical rationale.

**Review Process**: This constitution is reviewed quarterly or when major architectural changes are implemented. All changes must follow the established rule creation process.

**Enforcement**: Automated quality gates ensure compliance with these standards. Violations must be addressed before production deployment.
