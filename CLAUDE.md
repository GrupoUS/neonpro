# 🚀 VIBECODER

## 📚 ALWAYS READ AND LOAD References

- **🌟 Complete Workflow**: [`.ruler/dev-workflow.md`](./.ruler/dev-workflow.md)
- **⚙️ Always Follow Project Standards**: [`docs/project.md`](./docs/project.md)

## 🧠 CORE PHILOSOPHY

**Mantra**: _"Think → Research → Decompose → Plan → Implement → Validate"_
**Mission**: "Research first, think systematically, implement flawlessly"
**Core Principle**: "Simple systems that work over complex systems that don't"
**CRITICAL:** This project uses Archon for knowledge management, task tracking, and project organization. ALWAYS start with Archon MCP server task management.
**Always** use the native todos task list to track and execute tasks, after created by Archon.
**MANDATORY:** Always complete the full Archon task cycle before any coding

### MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES

**RIGHT TOOL FOR JOB**: Understand full context before implementation. Choose appropriate technology and mcp tools. Plan carefully, implement systematically
**NO INTERRUPTIONS**: Continue through ALL steps until problem fully solved
**MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Always begin with sequential-thinking tool
**ONLY TERMINATE WHEN**: User query COMPLETELY resolved and Problem 100% solved
**CRITICAL: This project uses Archon for knowledge management, task tracking, and project organization.**

## Core Archon Workflow Principles

**MANDATORY: Always complete the full Archon task cycle before any coding:**

1. **Check Current Task** → Review task details and requirements
2. **Research for Task** → Search relevant documentation and examples
3. **Implement the Task** → Write code based on research
4. **Update Task Status** → Move task from "todo" → "doing" → "review"
5. **Get Next Task** → Check for next priority task
6. **Repeat Cycle**

**Task Management Rules:**

- Update all actions to Archon
- Move tasks from "todo" → "doing" → "review" (not directly to complete)
- Maintain task descriptions and add implementation notes
- DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS - check project documentation for questions

## CORE ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES

```yaml
KISS_PRINCIPLE:
  definition: "Keep It Simple, Stupid - Simplicity is key"
  core_rules:
    - Choose simplest solution that meets requirements
    - Prefer readable code over clever optimizations
    - Reduce cognitive load
    - "Does this solve the core problem without unnecessary complexity?"
    - Use clear, descriptive naming and avoid Over-Engineering

YAGNI_PRINCIPLE:
  definition: "You Aren't Gonna Need It - Don't implement until needed"
  core_rules:
    - Build only what current requirements specify
    - Resist 'just in case' features
    - Refactor when requirements emerge
    - Focus on current user stories
    - Remove unused code immediately

CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT:
  definition: "Explicit step-by-step reasoning for accuracy"
  core_rules:
    - Break problems into sequential steps
    - Verbalize reasoning process
    - Show intermediate decisions
    - Question assumptions
    - Validate against requirements
    - Each step follows logically from previous steps
    - Final solution traced back to requirements
```
