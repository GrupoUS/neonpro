# MCP Connection Issue Resolution Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to address and resolve MCP connection issues related to bunx vs npx commands in Claude Desktop.

## Background
Based on research, the following key issues have been identified:
1. Using `bunx` to run Node.js-based MCP servers like Playwright can cause connection problems
2. `npx` may find the wrong Node.js version in PATH (e.g., v14 instead of v22)
3. The solution is to use Node.js directly with explicit PATH control instead of using `bunx` for Node.js-specific packages

## Current Configuration Analysis
From examining `.kilocode/mcp.json`:
- archon server uses "npx" command (which is correct)
- Most other servers use "pnpm" with "dlx"
- None of them currently use "bunx"

This suggests that the issue might have been already resolved by switching from bunx to npx for the archon server.

## Todo List

### 1. Research MCP connection issues with bunx vs npx ✅
- **Description**: Investigate the specific issues with using bunx vs npx for MCP servers in Claude Desktop, focusing on Node.js version conflicts and PATH problems.
- **Status**: Completed
- **Assignee**: apex-researcher

### 2. Analyze current MCP configuration ✅
- **Description**: Examine the current .kilocode/mcp.json file to understand which servers are using which commands and identify potential issues.
- **Status**: Completed
- **Assignee**: apex-researcher

### 3. Document MCP connection best practices
- **Description**: Create comprehensive documentation outlining best practices for configuring MCP servers, including when to use bunx, npx, pnpm dlx, or direct Node.js paths.
- **Status**: Todo
- **Priority**: High
- **Assignee**: apex-researcher

### 4. Create troubleshooting guide for MCP connection issues
- **Description**: Develop a step-by-step troubleshooting guide for resolving MCP connection issues, including Node.js version conflicts, PATH problems, and environment variables.
- **Status**: Todo
- **Priority**: High
- **Assignee**: apex-researcher

### 5. Review and update MCP configuration if needed
- **Description**: Based on research findings, review the current MCP configuration and make any necessary updates to ensure optimal compatibility and performance.
- **Status**: Todo
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Assignee**: apex-dev

### 6. Test MCP server connections
- **Description**: Test all MCP server connections to verify they work correctly with the current configuration and any changes made.
- **Status**: Todo
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Assignee**: apex-dev

### 7. Create documentation for future reference
- **Description**: Create comprehensive documentation in the project's docs folder for future reference, including the issue analysis, solutions, and best practices.
- **Status**: Todo
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Assignee**: apex-researcher

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Documentation (Tasks 3-4)
1. Create best practices guide for MCP server configuration
2. Develop troubleshooting guide for common issues

### Phase 2: Configuration Review (Tasks 5-6)
1. Review current MCP configuration
2. Make necessary updates
3. Test all server connections

### Phase 3: Knowledge Management (Task 7)
1. Create comprehensive documentation
2. Store in project's docs folder for future reference

## Success Criteria
- All MCP servers connect successfully
- Documentation is comprehensive and clear
- Team members can troubleshoot future issues independently
- Best practices are established and followed

## Next Steps
1. Begin with documenting MCP connection best practices
2. Proceed with configuration review and updates
3. Test all connections
4. Finalize documentation
