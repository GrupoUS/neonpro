# ðŸš€ NEONPRO PROJECT CONSTITUTION

## Overview

This document establishes the fundamental rules, principles, and standards for the NeonPro aesthetic clinic platform. It serves as the primary reference for all development activities and architectural decisions.

**Scope**: Healthcare-compliant aesthetic clinic management platform
**Related Documents**: See architecture docs and agent coordination guides

### Monorepo Structure

The project is organized into `apps` and `packages`:

*   `apps`: Contains the main applications.
    *   `web`: The main web application.
    *   `api`: The backend API.
*   `packages`: Contains shared code and libraries.
    *   `config`: Services related to configuration.
    *   `database`: Database utilities.
    *   `core`: Core functionality.
    *   `types`: Shared TypeScript types.
    *   `ui`: React component library.

### Key Commands

The following commands are available at the root of the monorepo:

**Development**
*   `bun dev`: Start the development servers for all apps.
*   `bun build`: Build all apps and packages.

**Testing (Functional)**
*   `bun test`: Run unit and integration tests for packages
*   `bun test:coverage`: Generate code coverage report
*   `bun test packages/types/src/__tests__/schemas.test.ts`: Test TypeScript schemas
*   `bun test packages/database/src/models/__tests__/performance-metrics.test.ts`: Test database models

**Quality Assurance**

*   `bun lint:fix`: Auto-fix linting issues
*   `bun format`: Format codebase with Biome
*   `bunx biome check`: Alternative code quality validation

**Type Safety**

*   `bunx biome check --apply`: Auto-fix code issues

## Core Principles

```yaml
CORE_STANDARDS:
  mantra: "Think â†’ Research â†’ Plan â†’ Decompose with atomic tasks â†’ Implement â†’ Validate"
  mission: "Research first, think systematically, implement flawlessly with cognitive intelligence"
  research_driven: "Multi-source validation for all complex implementations"
  vibecoder_integration: "Constitutional excellence with one-shot resolution philosophy"
  core_principle: "Simple systems that work over complex systems that don't"
  preserve_context: "Maintain complete context across all agent and thinking transitions"
  incorporate_always: "Incorporate what we already have, avoid creating new files, enhance the existing structure"
  always_audit: "Never assume the error is fixed, always audit and validate"
  COGNITIVE_ARCHITECTURE:
  meta_cognition: "Think about the thinking process, identify biases, apply constitutional analysis"
  multi_perspective_analysis:
    - "user_perspective: Understanding user intent and constraints"
    - "developer_perspective: Technical implementation and architecture considerations"
    - "business_perspective: Cost, timeline, and stakeholder impact analysis"
    - "security_perspective: Risk assessment and compliance requirements"
    - "quality_perspective: Standards enforcement and continuous improvement"
```

### Development Philosophy

**Mantra**: _"Think â†’ Research â†’ Decompose â†’ Plan â†’ Implement â†’ Validate"_

**KISS Principle**: Choose the simplest solution that meets requirements. Prioritize readable code over clever optimizations. Reduce cognitive load and avoid over-engineering.

**YAGNI Principle**: Build only what requirements specify. Resist "just in case" features. Refactor when requirements emerge. Focus on current user stories and remove unused, redundant and dead code immediately.

**Chain of Thought**: Break problems into sequential steps and atomic subtasks. Verbalize reasoning process. Show intermediate decisions. Validate against requirements.

### A.P.T.E Methodology

**Analyze** â†’ Comprehensive requirements analysis
**Plan** â†’ Strategic implementation planning
**Think** â†’ Metacognition and multi-perspective evaluation
**Execute** â†’ Systematic implementation with quality gates

**Quality Standard**: â‰¥9.5/10 rating on all deliveries

## Constitutional Authority

This document serves as the ultimate authority for NeonPro project development. All architectural decisions, technology choices, and development practices must align with these constitutional principles.

**Validation Requirements**: Any deviation from these standards requires explicit project leadership approval and documentation of the technical rationale.

**Review Process**: This constitution is reviewed quarterly or when major architectural changes are implemented. All changes must follow the established rule creation process.

**Enforcement**: Automated quality gates ensure compliance with these standards. Violations must be addressed before production deployment.
