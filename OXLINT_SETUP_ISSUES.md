# Oxlint Configuration Issues

## Current Status: ❌ BLOCKED

### Issue Description
Oxlint v1.15.0 is experiencing NAPI binding issues that prevent proper configuration loading and plugin activation.

### Error Details
```
Failed to load external plugin because no external linter was configured. 
This means the Oxlint binary was executed directly rather than via napi bindings.
```

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **NAPI Binding Problem**: oxlint requires proper NAPI bindings to load external plugins
2. **Binary Installation**: The installed binary may not be properly compiled for the current environment
3. **Platform Compatibility**: Possible WSL2/Node.js compatibility issues

### Configuration Status
- ✅ Created `.oxlintrc.json` with comprehensive healthcare compliance rules
- ✅ Converted from ES module format to JSONC format
- ❌ Configuration fails to load due to NAPI binding issues

### Temporary Solution
1. **Primary Linting**: Use traditional ESLint configuration
2. **Maintain oxlint config**: Keep `.oxlintrc.json` for future use
3. **Monitor oxlint updates**: Watch for fixes in future versions

### Future Resolution Steps
1. Monitor oxlint GitHub for NAPI binding fixes
2. Consider reinstallation when issues are resolved
3. Test with different Node.js versions if applicable
4. Explore alternative ultra-fast linting solutions

### Healthcare Compliance Maintained
- All rules preserved in `.oxlintrc.json`
- TypeScript safety rules configured
- React and accessibility rules included
- Security and compliance rules maintained
