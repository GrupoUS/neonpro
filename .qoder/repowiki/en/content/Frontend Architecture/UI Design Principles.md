## Introduction

This document outlines the UI design principles implemented in the neonpro frontend, focusing on the comprehensive design system that combines local and shared component libraries. The documentation covers the visual language, accessibility standards, theming capabilities, and architectural patterns that ensure consistency across the application. The design system follows atomic design principles while addressing specific requirements for healthcare applications, including LGPD compliance and WCAG 2.1 AA+ accessibility standards.

The neonpro frontend leverages a modular approach with components organized in both application-specific directories and shared packages, enabling reuse across different parts of the system while maintaining design consistency. This documentation serves as a reference for designers and developers working with the system, providing guidance on implementation patterns and best practices.

## Design System Overview

The neonpro design system is built on a foundation of reusable components from both local and shared packages, following atomic design principles to create a scalable and maintainable interface architecture. The system is organized into multiple layers, with base components in the shared `@neonpro/ui` package and application-specific implementations in the web app directory.

The component hierarchy follows a clear structure where atoms (basic elements like buttons and inputs) are combined into molecules (form fields), which are then composed into organisms (complex components like chat interfaces), templates (page layouts), and finally pages (complete views). This approach ensures consistency while allowing for flexibility in implementation.

The design system emphasizes accessibility from the ground up, with all components considering WCAG 2.1 AA+ guidelines during development. Components are designed to be inclusive by default, supporting keyboard navigation, screen readers, high contrast modes, and reduced motion preferences without requiring additional configuration.

## Visual Language and Styling

### Typography System

The typography system in neonpro follows a carefully curated hierarchy based on the Lora and Inter typefaces, with serif fonts used for headings and sans-serif for body text to create visual distinction. The system implements responsive font scaling with predefined sizes (small, medium, large, x-large) that can be adjusted through user preferences or system settings.

Text elements maintain appropriate line height and letter spacing to ensure readability, with semantic HTML elements used to convey document structure. The design system supports text resizing up to 200% without loss of functionality or content clipping, meeting WCAG success criterion 1.4.4.

### Color Scheme

The color palette is defined using OKLCH color space values in CSS custom properties, providing perceptually uniform color transitions and ensuring consistent appearance across different devices. The primary brand color is Pantone 4007C Gold (#AC9469), with complementary shades for secondary elements and accents.

```css
:root {
  --primary: oklch(0.6500 0.0600 39); /* Pantone 4007C Gold - #AC9469 */
  --secondary: oklch(0.8000 0.0600 82.4060); /* Lighter secondary */
  --background: oklch(0.9800 0.0020 48.7171); /* Cleaner white background */
  --foreground: oklch(0.2000 0.0400 260.0310); /* Darker text for better contrast */
}
```

The color system includes specific variables for different UI elements such as cards, popovers, inputs, and borders, ensuring visual consistency across components. All color combinations meet minimum contrast ratios of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text, satisfying WCAG 2.1 AA requirements.

### Spacing System

A consistent spacing system based on a 4px scale is implemented throughout the design system, with margin and padding values derived from this base unit. The system uses CSS custom properties to define spacing values, allowing for easy adjustments and theme variations.

The spacing system includes predefined values for touch targets, ensuring all interactive elements meet the minimum 44px Ã— 44px size recommended by WCAG 2.1 for mobile interfaces. This enhances usability for users with motor impairments or those using touch devices.

### Responsive Breakpoints

The responsive design system implements breakpoints aligned with common device categories:
- Mobile: up to 640px
- Tablet: 641px to 1024px
- Desktop: 1025px and above

Media queries are used to adjust layout, typography, and component behavior at these breakpoints, ensuring optimal user experience across devices. The system prioritizes mobile-first design principles, with enhancements added progressively for larger screens.

## Accessibility Implementation

### WCAG Compliance

The neonpro frontend implements comprehensive accessibility features following WCAG 2.1 AA+ guidelines across four main principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. The implementation includes semantic HTML structure, proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation support, and compatibility with assistive technologies.

All interactive components provide visible focus indicators that meet minimum thickness requirements, ensuring users can track their position when navigating via keyboard. Focus management is carefully handled in modal dialogs and dynamic content, preventing focus from becoming trapped or lost.

### Screen Reader Support

Components include appropriate ARIA labels, roles, and properties to convey their purpose and state to screen reader users. Live regions are implemented for dynamic content updates, allowing screen readers to announce changes without requiring user interaction.

The system includes utility functions for announcing important events to screen readers:

```typescript
const announceToScreenReader = (message: string, priority: 'polite' | 'assertive' = 'polite') => {
  // Implementation for announcing messages to screen readers
};
```

### Keyboard Navigation

Full keyboard operability is ensured across all components, with logical tab order and support for standard keyboard shortcuts. Interactive elements can be activated using both Enter and Space keys, following platform conventions.

Modal dialogs implement focus trapping to keep keyboard navigation contained within the dialog until dismissed. Skip links are provided to allow users to bypass repetitive navigation content and access main content directly.

### High Contrast and Reduced Motion

The design system supports high contrast mode through dedicated CSS classes that enhance color differences between text and background elements. Users can enable high contrast mode through system preferences or application settings.

Motion reduction is respected through the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query, which disables non-essential animations and transitions for users who prefer reduced motion:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *,
  *::before,
  *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

### Accessible Form Controls

Form components include proper labeling with explicit associations between labels and input elements. Error states are communicated through both color and text, ensuring information is not conveyed by color alone.

Validation messages are programmatically associated with their respective fields using ARIA attributes, and form submission errors are announced to assistive technologies. Required fields are clearly indicated through both visual cues and ARIA attributes.

## Component Architecture

### Atomic Design Implementation

The component hierarchy follows atomic design principles with clear separation between different levels of abstraction. Base components (atoms) are defined in the shared `@neonpro/ui` package, while composite components (molecules and organisms) are implemented in the application layer.

Atoms include fundamental UI elements such as buttons, inputs, labels, and badges. These components are designed to be highly reusable and style-agnostic, exposing props for customization while maintaining consistent behavior.

Molecules combine atoms into functional units, such as form fields that pair an input with its label and validation message. Organisms represent complex, self-contained components like the chat interface or calendar widget, which orchestrate multiple molecules and atoms to create complete user experiences.

### Shared vs. Local Components

The design system distinguishes between shared components in the `packages/ui` directory and application-specific components in `apps/web/src/components`. Shared components are intended for cross-application reuse and follow stricter API contracts, while local components can be more tightly coupled to specific use cases.

Shared components are organized into categories:
- **ui**: Base primitive components (buttons, inputs, cards)
- **forms**: Healthcare-specific form controls
- **healthcare**: Medical application components (consent banners, patient data displays)
- **aceternity**: Animated decorative elements
- **magicui**: Specialized UI patterns

Local components extend or compose shared components to meet specific application requirements, such as the `NeonProChatProvider` which wraps the copilot kit with application-specific configuration and state management.

### Component Composition Patterns

Components are designed with composition in mind, using React's children prop and render props patterns to enable flexible usage. Higher-order components and custom hooks provide shared logic that can be consumed by multiple components.

The `NeonProChatProvider` demonstrates a provider pattern that manages chat state and makes it available to consuming components through context:

```tsx
export const NeonProChatProvider: React.FC<NeonProChatProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  config: userConfig
}) => {
  // State management and context value definition
  return (
    <ChatContext.Provider value={value}>
      {children}
    </ChatContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

This pattern allows multiple components to access and update shared state without prop drilling, while maintaining a clean separation between presentation and logic.

## Theming and Dark Mode

### Theme Context Implementation

The theming system is built around React Context, providing a `ThemeContext` that components can consume to access current theme settings. The context exposes methods for changing theme properties and persists user preferences using localStorage.

```typescript
const ThemeContext = createContext<ThemeContextValue | null>(null);
```

The theme provider component wraps the application and injects CSS custom properties into the document root, allowing both JavaScript and CSS to access theme values. This approach enables runtime theme switching without requiring page reloads.

### Light and Dark Themes

The design system includes fully implemented light and dark themes with carefully selected color values that maintain appropriate contrast ratios in both modes. The themes are defined using OKLCH color space for perceptual uniformity and color accuracy.

Light theme values prioritize clean, professional aesthetics suitable for clinical environments, with off-white backgrounds and subtle accent colors. Dark theme values reduce eye strain in low-light conditions while maintaining readability and brand identity.

Theme switching is implemented through a combination of user preference settings and system-level detection using the `prefers-color-scheme` media query. Users can override automatic detection through manual selection in the application settings.

### Customization Capabilities

The theming system supports customization at multiple levels, from global theme selection to component-specific overrides. Developers can extend the theme by adding new color roles or modifying existing ones through configuration objects.

Custom themes can be created by defining a complete set of CSS custom properties that follow the established naming convention. The system validates theme completeness and provides fallback values for missing properties to prevent rendering issues.

```typescript
const customTheme = {
  primary: '#AC9469',
  secondary: '#112031',
  background: '#D2D0C8',
  text: '#112031',
  // Additional theme properties
};
```

Theme installation is handled by a utility function that injects CSS into the document head, ensuring styles are available before component rendering:

```typescript
export function installThemeStyles(target?: Document) {
  if (typeof document === "undefined") return;
  const head = (target ?? document).head;
  if (!head) return;
  // avoid duplicate injection
  if (head.querySelector("style[data-neonpro-theme]")) return;
  const style = document.createElement("style");
  style.setAttribute("data-neonpro-theme", "true");
  style.textContent = themeCss;
  head.appendChild(style);
}
```

## Responsive Design

### Mobile-First Approach

The responsive design strategy follows mobile-first principles, with base styles optimized for small screens and enhancements added progressively for larger viewports. This ensures optimal performance and usability on mobile devices, which are commonly used in clinical settings.

Touch targets are sized appropriately for finger interaction, with minimum dimensions of 44px Ã— 44px and adequate spacing between interactive elements. Gesture support is implemented for common interactions like swiping and pinching, enhancing the mobile user experience.

### Adaptive Layouts

Layout components adapt to available screen space, reorganizing content to maintain usability across different device sizes. The dashboard layout component, for example, rearranges cards based on container dimensions and supports manual repositioning through drag-and-drop interactions.

Media queries trigger layout changes at defined breakpoints, adjusting grid structures, navigation patterns, and content density. On smaller screens, navigation is consolidated into hamburger menus or tab bars, while larger screens display navigation inline for quicker access.

### Performance Optimization

Responsive components are optimized for performance across network conditions and device capabilities. Image resources are served in appropriate sizes based on screen resolution, and non-essential animations are disabled on lower-powered devices.

The system implements code splitting for major components, loading only the necessary code for the current view and device type. This reduces initial load time and memory usage, particularly important for mobile users with limited bandwidth or storage.

## Cross-Browser Compatibility

### Browser Support Strategy

The neonpro frontend supports modern browsers with a focus on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge versions from the past two years. Legacy browser support is limited to ensure compatibility with modern web standards and security requirements.

Critical functionality is tested across supported browsers to ensure consistent behavior, with particular attention to CSS rendering differences, JavaScript API availability, and accessibility feature support.

### Feature Detection and Polyfills

The system employs feature detection rather than browser sniffing to determine capability support. Modern JavaScript features are transpiled to compatible syntax using build tools, and critical polyfills are included for essential APIs not available in target browsers.

CSS custom properties (variables) are supported in all targeted browsers, enabling the dynamic theming system. For older browsers that don't support CSS variables, fallback values are provided to maintain basic functionality.

### Testing and Validation

Automated testing includes cross-browser checks using tools like Playwright to verify rendering and interaction consistency. Manual testing is performed on physical devices representing different platforms and browser combinations.

The system monitors browser usage statistics to inform support decisions and prioritize testing efforts. When significant portions of users rely on specific browser versions, targeted fixes are implemented to address compatibility issues.

## Extending the Design System

### Creating New Components

When extending the design system with new components, developers should follow established patterns for structure, styling, and accessibility. New components should be added to the appropriate package based on their intended scope of reuse.

Shared components belong in the `packages/ui` directory and should:
- Follow atomic design principles
- Use CSS custom properties for styling
- Implement full keyboard navigation support
- Include comprehensive TypeScript types
- Provide default ARIA attributes
- Support theme variations

Application-specific components are placed in `apps/web/src/components` and may have tighter coupling to application logic while still adhering to design system guidelines.

### Style Consistency

New components must maintain visual consistency with existing elements by using the established color palette, typography scale, and spacing system. Direct color values should be avoided in favor of CSS custom properties to ensure theme compatibility.

Component APIs should follow consistent naming conventions and prop patterns established in the design system. Boolean props should use positive naming (e.g., `isLoading` rather than `notLoaded`), and event handlers should follow the `on[Event]` naming convention.

### Documentation Requirements

All new components require documentation that includes:
- Usage examples with code samples
- Prop type definitions and descriptions
- Accessibility considerations
- Theming capabilities
- Responsive behavior
- Performance characteristics

Documentation should be added to the component's source file and included in the design system documentation site. Visual examples should demonstrate the component in various states and configurations.

## Performance Considerations

### Rendering Efficiency

Components are optimized for efficient rendering through careful state management and avoidance of unnecessary re-renders. React.memo is used for components with expensive render operations, and callback functions are memoized using useCallback to prevent downstream re-renders.

The virtualized list component minimizes DOM nodes by only rendering visible items, improving performance with large datasets. Similarly, the dashboard layout optimizes positioning calculations to prevent layout thrashing during drag operations.

### Memory Management

The system implements proper cleanup for event listeners, timers, and subscriptions to prevent memory leaks. Components unmount cleanly, releasing references to external resources and canceling pending operations.

Memory usage is monitored during development, with performance tests ensuring that components do not exhibit memory growth over time. The chat provider, for example, limits message history size and provides methods for clearing chat state.

### Bundle Optimization

The build process optimizes bundle size through tree-shaking, code splitting, and minification. Unused component variants and development-only code are excluded from production builds.

Lazy loading is implemented for major application sections, reducing initial load time. Critical components are prioritized in the main bundle, while less frequently used features are loaded on demand.

### Animation Performance

Animations are implemented using CSS transforms and opacity changes, which are optimized by the browser's compositor layer. JavaScript animations are limited to cases where CSS cannot achieve the desired effect, and requestAnimationFrame is used for smooth timing.

The system respects user preferences for reduced motion, disabling non-essential animations when requested. Performance monitoring ensures that animations maintain 60fps even on lower-end devices.
