## Test Organization and Configuration
The neonpro project follows a structured test organization pattern with tests located in `__tests__` directories adjacent to their corresponding source files. The primary configuration is defined in `vitest.config.ts`, which establishes the testing environment with node as the execution context and specifies inclusion patterns for test files. The configuration includes comprehensive environment variable setup for Supabase integration, ensuring consistent test behavior across different environments. Test discovery is configured to include files matching the patterns `tests/**/*.{test,spec}.{ts,tsx}` and `src/**/*.{test,spec}.{ts,tsx}`, while excluding build artifacts and external directories. The test runner is configured with a 20-second timeout threshold and bail-on-failure behavior to quickly identify critical issues. Module resolution aliases are established for shared packages, enabling clean imports across the monorepo structure. This organized approach ensures that tests are discoverable, maintainable, and properly isolated from production code.

## Mocking Strategies with vi.mock()
The neonpro project employs sophisticated mocking strategies using Vitest's `vi.mock()` functionality to isolate units under test and simulate external dependencies. In the predictive client analytics tests, comprehensive mocks are created for database, machine learning, and audit services, allowing focused testing of business logic without relying on actual external systems. These mocks use Jest-style function mocks that can track calls, return predefined values, or reject with specific errors to test various scenarios. For LGPD compliance testing, similar mocking patterns are applied to database and audit services, enabling validation of data protection logic without accessing real patient information. The test setup also includes middleware mocks for authentication, LGPD compliance, and healthcare professional verification, which can be easily composed in different combinations to test various authorization scenarios. This approach ensures that tests are fast, reliable, and focused on the specific functionality being validated.

## Assertion Patterns and Test Validation
The neonpro project implements comprehensive assertion patterns to validate both successful outcomes and error conditions in healthcare business logic. Tests extensively use Vitest's expect API with chained matchers to verify complex object structures, including partial matches with `expect.objectContaining()` and array membership with `expect.arrayContaining()`. For numeric values, assertions include tolerance checks using `expect.any(Number)` to account for floating-point calculations. The predictive analytics tests demonstrate sophisticated assertion patterns that validate not only the primary prediction results but also secondary effects like audit logging and recommendation generation. Similarly, LGPD compliance tests verify that data redaction occurs correctly across nested objects and arrays while maintaining proper audit trails. Error handling is thoroughly tested by mocking service failures and asserting that appropriate fallback behaviors and error responses are generated, ensuring system resilience in production environments.

## Domain-Specific Testing Approaches
The neonpro project implements specialized testing approaches for healthcare domain logic, addressing unique requirements such as patient registration, appointment conflict detection, and LGPD compliance. For patient registration, tests validate that all mandatory fields are present, data formats comply with Brazilian standards (CPF, RG), and proper consent mechanisms are enforced. Appointment conflict detection tests verify that scheduling rules prevent overlapping appointments for the same patient or provider, considering various appointment types and durations. LGPD compliance testing focuses on three key areas: PII (Personally Identifiable Information) detection and redaction, consent management lifecycle, and data retention policies. Tests validate that sensitive fields like CPF, email, and phone numbers are automatically detected and appropriately masked based on sensitivity levels. Consent validation tests ensure that data processing only occurs when valid, unexpired consents exist for the required purposes, with proper handling of consent revocation and expiration.

## Test Fixtures and Parameterized Testing
The neonpro project utilizes test fixtures and parameterized testing to ensure comprehensive coverage of healthcare business logic across various scenarios. Test setup files provide standardized fixtures for common entities like test users, healthcare professionals, and LGPD consent records, ensuring consistency across test suites. The predictive client analytics tests demonstrate parameterized testing by validating retention predictions across different risk levels (low, medium, high) using the same test structure with varying input data. Similarly, LGPD compliance tests use parameterization to verify PII detection and redaction across different field types (CPF, email, phone) and data structures (flat objects, nested objects, arrays). This approach reduces code duplication while increasing test coverage, allowing the team to efficiently validate edge cases and boundary conditions in clinical workflows. The use of beforeEach and afterEach hooks ensures proper test isolation and cleanup between parameterized test runs.

## Snapshot Testing Across Domains
While not explicitly shown in the provided test files, the neonpro project's architecture supports snapshot testing for validating complex data structures and UI components across healthcare domains. The configuration and testing patterns suggest that snapshot testing would be applied to verify the structure of API responses, audit log entries, and consent records. For predictive analytics, snapshots could capture the complete structure of retention predictions, including risk factors, recommendations, and confidence scores. In LGPD compliance, snapshots would validate the format of data export responses and audit trail entries, ensuring they meet regulatory requirements. The use of standardized data models and type definitions facilitates reliable snapshot testing by providing consistent output structures. This approach helps prevent unintended changes to data contracts and ensures backward compatibility in clinical data exchange.

## Handling Asynchronous Services
The neonpro project implements robust patterns for testing asynchronous services, which are prevalent in healthcare applications due to database operations, API calls, and background processing. Tests use async/await syntax consistently to handle promises and ensure proper timing of assertions. The predictive analytics service tests demonstrate handling of multiple concurrent database queries using Promise.all, with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms. For time-dependent logic, tests utilize Jest's fake timers (jest.useFakeTimers()) to control the passage of time and validate caching behaviors and expiration logic without introducing flakiness. Error boundary testing includes mocking rejected promises to verify that services gracefully handle database connection failures, network timeouts, and third-party service outages. The test configuration includes adequate timeout settings (20 seconds) to accommodate slower operations while preventing indefinite hangs during test execution.

## Partial Mocking of Complex Services
The neonpro project demonstrates effective partial mocking strategies for complex services, allowing granular control over specific methods while preserving others. In the predictive client analytics tests, the service under test has its internal methods like calculateRiskFactors and generateRecommendations tested directly through casting to any type, enabling white-box testing of private logic. This approach allows the team to validate individual components of the prediction algorithm without executing the entire workflow. For LGPD compliance testing, partial mocking is used to isolate PII detection from redaction logic, ensuring each component can be tested independently. The use of jest.fn() for method mocks provides fine-grained control over return values and call tracking, enabling precise simulation of different scenarios. This strategy strikes a balance between test isolation and realistic integration, ensuring that complex services are thoroughly validated at both unit and integration levels.

## Testing Error Boundary Conditions
The neonpro project places strong emphasis on testing error boundary conditions in clinical workflows, recognizing the critical importance of reliability in healthcare systems. Tests explicitly validate how services handle missing data, expired consents, database connectivity issues, and invalid inputs. The predictive analytics tests include scenarios with incomplete feature sets, verifying that the system returns appropriate fallback responses rather than failing catastrophically. LGPD compliance tests validate error handling for database failures during consent validation, ensuring that access is denied safely when consent status cannot be verified. The test suite also covers edge cases like dry-run modes for data retention processing and legal hold exceptions for data deletion requests. These comprehensive error condition tests ensure that the system maintains data integrity and patient safety even when unexpected issues occur, adhering to healthcare industry standards for system reliability.
