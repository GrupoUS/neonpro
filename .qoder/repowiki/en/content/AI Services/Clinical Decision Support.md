## Treatment Recommendation Engine

The treatment recommendation engine analyzes patient assessments to generate evidence-based treatment suggestions. It evaluates multiple factors including skin type, medical history, aesthetic goals, and budget constraints to determine suitable procedures. The engine calculates a suitability score by combining skin compatibility, medical safety, goal alignment, and budget fit metrics. Each recommendation includes confidence, efficacy, safety, and suitability scores ranging from 0 to 1, providing clinicians with quantitative measures of recommendation quality. The system also specifies expected results timeline, improvement expectations, longevity, associated risks with probability estimates, contraindications, alternative options, cost, number of sessions required, recovery information, and evidence level according to evidence-based medicine standards.

## Risk Assessment and Contraindication Detection

The risk assessment system performs comprehensive contraindication analysis for proposed aesthetic procedures. It examines patient data including medical conditions, current medications, allergies, and pregnancy status against procedure-specific contraindications. The system distinguishes between absolute contraindications (which prevent procedure execution) and relative contraindications (which require caution and additional monitoring). For each procedure, it identifies relevant risk factors and generates specific recommendations for safe implementation. The analysis considers both medical contraindications from the patient's history and procedural contraindications based on aesthetic guidelines. When absolute contraindications are detected, the system suggests modified approaches or alternative treatments to ensure patient safety while achieving desired aesthetic outcomes.

## Regulatory Compliance Framework

The system implements a comprehensive regulatory compliance framework to adhere to Brazilian healthcare regulations, particularly the LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados). The lgpd-middleware ensures that all data processing activities have proper consent based on specific purposes such as medical care, appointment scheduling, or billing. The middleware checks for valid consent before allowing access to protected health information and logs all data access events for audit purposes. For operations requiring explicit consent, the system enforces strict mode policies that deny access when consent is missing. The framework also supports data portability and erasure requests as mandated by LGPD Article 18, allowing patients to export their data or request its deletion/anonymization in accordance with their rights.

## Audit Logging and Accountability

The audit logging system provides comprehensive accountability for all clinical decision support activities. Implemented through the audit-log middleware, it captures detailed information about every interaction with the system, including timestamps, user identifiers, actions performed, resources accessed, IP addresses, user agents, and request durations. Sensitive data fields are automatically redacted to protect patient privacy while maintaining the integrity of the audit trail. The system categorizes audit logs by domain, with specialized configurations for healthcare, financial, and authentication operations, each with appropriate sensitivity settings. All audit entries are logged with contextual metadata and can be used for compliance verification, security investigations, and system optimization. The middleware integrates with the application's logging infrastructure to ensure reliable storage and retrieval of audit records.

## Handling Incomplete Medical Histories

The clinical decision support system includes robust mechanisms for handling incomplete medical histories. When patient data is partial or missing, the system calculates confidence levels for its recommendations based on data completeness. Lower confidence scores trigger additional verification steps and conservative treatment suggestions. The system identifies specific data gaps and recommends targeted information collection to improve assessment accuracy. For critical missing information such as allergy history or medication lists, the system defaults to safer alternatives and issues clear warnings about potential risks. The recommendation engine adjusts its algorithms to account for uncertainty, prioritizing procedures with broader safety margins when comprehensive medical history is unavailable. This approach ensures patient safety while still providing valuable guidance even with limited information.

## Drug Interaction Management

The drug interaction management system proactively identifies potential conflicts between proposed aesthetic treatments and a patient's current medications. Through the analyzeProcedureContraindications method, the system cross-references the patient's medication list with known contraindications for each procedure. When relevant medications are detected, they are flagged as relative contraindications requiring additional monitoring or modification of the treatment plan. The system maintains a database of medication-procedure interactions and updates this knowledge base with current medical research. For high-risk combinations, the system recommends alternative treatments or modified approaches that minimize adverse event potential. The integration with electronic health records ensures that medication lists are always up-to-date, supporting accurate interaction screening.

## Confidence Level Determination

The system determines confidence levels for its recommendations based on the completeness and quality of available patient data. The calculateConfidence method evaluates various factors including the comprehensiveness of medical history, presence of relevant diagnostic tests, consistency of reported symptoms, and availability of follow-up data from previous treatments. Higher confidence scores are assigned when multiple data sources corroborate findings, while lower scores reflect uncertainty due to missing or conflicting information. These confidence metrics are incorporated into treatment recommendations, helping clinicians assess the reliability of AI-generated suggestions. The system also considers the evidence level of supporting medical literature when determining overall confidence, giving greater weight to recommendations backed by high-quality studies.
