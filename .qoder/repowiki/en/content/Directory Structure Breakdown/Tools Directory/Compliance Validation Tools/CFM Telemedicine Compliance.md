## Introduction

The CFM (Conselho Federal de Medicina) telemedicine compliance sub-component ensures adherence to Brazilian medical regulations for remote healthcare services, specifically implementing Resolution CFM 2.314/2022. This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the validation framework that verifies physician licensing, patient identification, and medical record keeping requirements for telemedicine consultations.

The system integrates multiple compliance frameworks including CFM regulations, LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados), and NGS2 (Norma Geral de Segurança de Nível 2) security standards to ensure comprehensive regulatory adherence. The implementation focuses on automated validation of video consultation security, prescription validity, and professional registration checks while maintaining clinical workflow efficiency.

This document explains the relationship between automated CFM compliance checks and clinical workflow requirements, addressing common issues like real-time license verification through integration with official medical registries and time-stamped session records. The content is designed to be accessible to beginners while providing sufficient technical depth for experienced developers looking to extend the validation framework for specialty-specific telemedicine requirements.

## CFM Compliance Framework Overview

The CFM compliance framework implements a multi-layered approach to telemedicine regulation enforcement, covering all critical aspects of remote healthcare delivery as mandated by Brazilian medical authorities. The system is structured around seven core compliance domains:

- [compliance.config.json](file://packages/config/src/compliance.config.json#L1-L397)

The framework operates on a continuous validation model, where compliance checks are performed at multiple stages of the telemedicine workflow:

- Pre-consultation: Professional licensing and patient identity verification
- Session initiation: Informed consent collection and security protocol establishment
- During consultation: Real-time monitoring of compliance parameters
- Post-consultation: Medical record integrity verification and audit trail generation

Each compliance domain is assigned a severity level (critical, high, medium, low) based on potential impact to patient safety and regulatory requirements. The system calculates an overall compliance score from 0-100, with penalties applied for each identified violation according to its severity.

## Core Components and Architecture

The CFM telemedicine compliance system consists of several interconnected components that work together to ensure regulatory adherence throughout the telemedicine workflow. The architecture follows a service-oriented design pattern with clear separation of concerns between validation, data storage, and monitoring functions.

The system architecture comprises three main layers:

1. **API Layer**: The `CFMComplianceService` class provides the primary interface for compliance validation, orchestrating calls to various validation methods and aggregating results into a comprehensive compliance report.

2. **Database Service Layer**: The `CFMComplianceServiceDB` handles data persistence and retrieval operations, interfacing directly with the PostgreSQL database to validate professional licenses, create telemedicine sessions, and perform detailed compliance checks.

3. **Data Model Layer**: Defines the structure of validation requests and responses, ensuring consistent data exchange between components and proper type safety.

The components communicate through well-defined interfaces and use asynchronous operations to ensure non-blocking execution. Error handling is implemented consistently across all layers, with healthcare-specific error logging to facilitate troubleshooting and auditing.

## Telemedicine Compliance Validation

The telemedicine compliance validation process implements CFM Resolution 2.314/2022 requirements through a comprehensive set of automated checks that verify adherence to professional, technical, and ethical standards. The validation framework assesses multiple dimensions of telemedicine practice to ensure patient safety and regulatory compliance.

- [cfm-compliance.service.ts](file://packages/database/src/services/cfm-compliance.service.ts#L139-L261)

The validation process begins with professional license verification, confirming that the consulting physician holds a valid CRM (Conselho Regional de Medicina) registration in good standing. This check validates both the CRM number and state code against official records, with provisions for integration with the CFM's external API for real-time validation.

Patient identity verification requires at least two forms of identification, typically CPF (Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas) and RG (Registro Geral), with optional CNS (Cartão Nacional de Saúde) validation. The system employs robust validation algorithms to verify document authenticity and prevent identity fraud.

Informed consent is obtained electronically prior to the consultation, with explicit acknowledgment of the patient's rights and responsibilities during telemedicine sessions. The consent process includes disclosure of recording policies, data usage, and emergency procedures.

Security protocols establish end-to-end encryption using AES-256 for all communication, with WebRTC-based video conferencing secured through DTLS-SRTP encryption and ICE/STUN/TURN server configuration. Multi-factor authentication is required for both patients and professionals accessing the platform.

Session recording is managed according to strict compliance rules, requiring explicit patient consent before any recording can commence. Recordings are stored with cryptographic hashing to ensure integrity and are subject to defined retention periods in accordance with medical record keeping requirements.

Emergency protocols are verified to ensure that physicians have established procedures for handling medical emergencies during remote consultations, including immediate referral pathways to local healthcare facilities and emergency contact information.

Digital prescription validation ensures that all electronic prescriptions include proper digital signatures compliant with ICP-Brasil standards, with special handling for controlled substances as required by ANVISA regulations.

An immutable audit trail documents all key events throughout the validation process, including timestamped records of license checks, consent collection, security setup, and final compliance determination. This audit trail serves as evidence of regulatory adherence and supports internal quality assurance processes.

## Licensing and Professional Registration

The professional licensing validation system implements a robust framework for verifying physician credentials in accordance with CFM Resolution 2.314/2022 Article 4 requirements. The implementation provides both immediate validation through local database checks and provisions for external verification against official medical registries.

```mermaid

- [20250128_cfm_telemedicine_platform.sql](file://packages/database/migrations/20250128_cfm_telemedicine_platform.sql#L1-L665)

The licensing validation process follows these steps:

1. **Initial Database Lookup**: The system first queries the local `cfm_professional_licenses` table to check if the physician's CRM number and state combination exists in the database. This provides immediate validation for frequently used practitioners.

2. **Status Verification**: If found, the system verifies that the license status is "active" and that the expiration date (if present) has not passed. Licenses marked as expired, suspended, or revoked fail validation.

3. **External Validation Fallback**: When a license is not found in the local database, the system creates a placeholder record with "pending_validation" status and returns a result indicating that external CFM validation is required.

4. **Asynchronous External Check**: The system is designed to integrate with the CFM's official API for real-time license verification, though this integration is currently pending implementation.

The data model for professional licenses includes comprehensive fields to capture all relevant information:

```json
{
  "crm_number": "string",
  "crm_state": "string",
  "full_name": "string",
  "specialties": ["string"],
  "license_status": "active|expired|suspended|revoked",
  "license_expiry_date": "date",
  "last_cfm_validation": "timestamp",
  "validation_method": "api|manual|document",
  "validation_status": "pending|validated|rejected|expired"
}
```

The system also maintains historical validation records to support audit requirements and track changes in license status over time. Each validation attempt is logged with timestamps and method information to provide a complete audit trail.

For performance optimization, the system employs indexing on the composite CRM number and state fields, enabling rapid lookups even with large datasets. Additionally, a materialized view `cfm_compliance_dashboard` provides real-time metrics on license validation success rates and compliance trends.

## Patient Identification and Consent Management

The patient identification and consent management system implements CFM Resolution 2.314/2022 requirements for verifying patient identity and obtaining informed consent in telemedicine consultations. The framework ensures compliance with both medical ethics standards and data protection regulations (LGPD).

**Diagram sources**

- [cfm-compliance.service.ts](file://packages/database/src/services/cfm-compliance.service.ts#L548-L625)
- [20250918_telemedicine_session_table.sql](file://packages/database/migrations/20250918_telemedicine_session_table.sql#L1-L142)

The patient identification process requires verification of at least two official documents:

- **CPF (Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas)**: Mandatory national identification number with algorithmic validation to detect fraudulent numbers
- **RG (Registro Geral)**: Mandatory official identification document issued by state authorities
- **CNS (Cartão Nacional de Saúde)**: Optional but recommended national health card

The system employs a multi-step validation process for patient identity:

1. **Document Collection**: Patients upload scanned copies or photographs of their identification documents through a secure portal.

2. **Format Validation**: The system verifies that document numbers conform to expected formats (e.g., CPF must be 11 digits, RG varies by state).

3. **Algorithmic Verification**: For CPF numbers, the system applies the official validation algorithm to confirm mathematical correctness and detect common fraud patterns.

4. **Cross-Verification**: The system checks for consistency between names, dates of birth, and other personal information across submitted documents.

5. **Risk Assessment**: Documents are evaluated for signs of tampering or poor quality that might indicate fraudulent submission.

Informed consent is managed through a digital process that captures patient agreement to telemedicine terms and conditions. The system implements several consent types:

- **General Consultation Consent**: Covers standard telemedicine consultation terms, privacy policies, and data usage
- **Recording Consent**: Specific authorization for audio/video recording of the consultation
- **Special Procedure Consent**: Additional consent for specialized treatments or diagnostic procedures
- **Data Sharing Consent**: Permission for sharing medical information with other healthcare providers

Each consent is time-stamped and associated with the patient's verified identity. The system generates a unique consent ID and stores the agreement in an immutable format to prevent repudiation. Consent records include metadata such as:

- Date and time of consent
- IP address and device information
- User agent string
- Digital fingerprint of the consent document
- Hash of the signed agreement

The audit trail captures all consent-related activities, including initial collection, modifications, and revocation requests. This comprehensive documentation supports compliance with both CFM regulations and LGPD requirements for data subject rights.

- [20250918_telemedicine_session_table.sql](file://packages/database/migrations/20250918_telemedicine_session_table.sql#L1-L142)

The digital prescription validation process follows these key steps:

1. **Clinical Validation**: Before signing, the system verifies that the prescribed medication is appropriate for the diagnosed condition, checking against evidence-based guidelines and formulary restrictions.

2. **Drug Interaction Screening**: The system analyzes potential interactions between the prescribed medication and the patient's current medications, allergies, and medical conditions.

3. **Controlled Substance Verification**: For medications classified as controlled substances, the system interfaces with ANVISA's regulatory database to verify that the physician has proper authorization to prescribe these medications.

4. **Digital Signature Application**: Validated prescriptions are signed using ICP-Brasil certified digital certificates, ensuring authenticity and non-repudiation. The signature process uses AES-256 encryption with secure key management.

5. **Audit Trail Generation**: Each prescription event is recorded in an immutable audit log, including:
   - Timestamp of creation and signing
   - Physician's CRM number and digital certificate
   - Patient identification
   - Medication details and dosage
   - Clinical justification
   - Digital signature hash

The system enforces several critical requirements for digital prescriptions:

- **Mandatory Digital Signature**: All electronic prescriptions must be digitally signed using ICP-Brasil compliant certificates
- **Controlled Substances Tracking**: Special handling and additional documentation for Schedule A, B, and C medications
- **Prescription Validity Period**: Time-limited validity based on medication type and patient condition
- **Refill Authorization**: Clear indication of allowed refills and expiration date
- **Pharmacy Notification**: Automatic transmission to designated pharmacies with patient consent

The data model for digital prescriptions includes comprehensive fields to capture all regulatory requirements:

```json
{
  "prescriptions": [
    {
      "medication": "string",
      "dosage": "string",
      "frequency": "string",
      "duration": "string",
      "clinical_justification": "string",
      "controlled_substance": "boolean",
      "refills_allowed": "number",
      "valid_until": "date",
      "digital_signature": {
        "certificate_serial": "string",
        "signature_hash": "string",
        "signed_at": "timestamp",
        "certificate_authority": "string"
      },
      "audit_trail": [
        {
          "event": "created|modified|signed|transmitted",
          "timestamp": "datetime",
          "user_id": "string",
          "details": "string"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The system also implements business rules to prevent common prescription errors:

- Duplicate therapy detection
- Dosage range validation based on patient age and weight
- Duration limits for antibiotics and opioids
- Formulary compliance checks
- Prior authorization requirements

These validation mechanisms ensure that digital prescriptions meet both clinical safety standards and regulatory requirements, reducing medication errors and supporting accountable prescribing practices.

- [cfm-telemedicine.test.ts](file://apps/api/tests/integration/cfm-telemedicine.test.ts#L1-L628)

The framework includes several key components:

### CFM Validator Class

The `CFMValidator` provides static methods for validating different aspects of compliance:

```typescript
class CFMValidator {
  static validateProfessionalLicensing(data: CFMTestData): boolean
  static validateTelemedicineCompliance(data: CFMTestData): boolean
  static validateDigitalPrescription(data: CFMTestData): boolean
  static validatePatientConfidentiality(data: CFMTestData): boolean
  static validateCompliance(data: CFMTestData): ValidationResult
}
```

Each validation method returns a boolean indicating compliance status, while the comprehensive validation returns detailed results including violations and recommendations.

### Test Suite Creation

The framework provides a utility function `createCFMTestSuite` that generates standardized test suites for different compliance scenarios:

```typescript
function createCFMTestSuite(testName: string, testData: CFMTestData)
```

This function creates a Vitest suite with predefined test cases for:

- Professional licensing validation
- Telemedicine requirements (when enabled)
- Digital prescription requirements (when enabled)
- Patient confidentiality
- Overall CFM compliance

### Mock Data Generation

The `createMockCFMData` function generates realistic test data with proper defaults:

```typescript
function createMockCFMData(overrides: Partial<CFMTestData> = {})
```

The mock data includes valid CRM numbers, active licenses, proper consent flags, and compliant security settings, with the ability to override any field for testing edge cases.

### Integration Testing

The system includes comprehensive integration tests that verify end-to-end compliance workflows:

- **Session creation**: Tests the complete process of creating a CFM-compliant telemedicine session
- **License validation**: Verifies integration between the API and database layers for license checks
- **Compliance scoring**: Validates the calculation of compliance scores and penalty application
- **Audit trail generation**: Confirms proper logging of all compliance-related events

### Test Coverage

The testing framework covers all critical compliance areas:

1. **Professional Licensing**: Tests for valid/invalid CRM numbers, expired/suspended licenses, and specialty verification
2. **Patient Identification**: Tests for complete/incomplete identification documents and validation failures
3. **Informed Consent**: Tests for proper consent collection, recording consent, and withdrawal handling
4. **Digital Prescriptions**: Tests for valid/invalid digital signatures and controlled substance handling
5. **Security Protocols**: Tests for encryption, authentication, and access control failures
6. **Emergency Protocols**: Tests for presence/absence of emergency procedures
7. **Data Retention**: Tests for proper retention period enforcement

The test suite also includes negative testing scenarios to verify proper error handling and violation reporting. These tests intentionally introduce compliance violations to ensure the system correctly identifies and reports them.

The framework supports both automated CI/CD pipeline execution and manual testing scenarios, enabling comprehensive validation throughout the development lifecycle.
