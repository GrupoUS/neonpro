## Category
Development

## Complexity
High

## MCP Tools Required
- sequential-thinking
- archon
- tavily
- context7

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Request Analysis and Understanding
1. **User Request Processing**
   - Parse natural language user request
   - Extract key requirements and constraints
   - Identify implicit needs and expectations
   - Map to healthcare domain context

2. **Research and Validation**
   - Use Tavily for external research and validation
   - Context7 for official documentation and APIs
   - Validate technical feasibility
   - Research healthcare compliance requirements

### Phase 2: PRD Generation
1. **Structured PRD Creation**
   - Create comprehensive Product Requirements Document
   - Define feature objectives and success criteria
   - Outline user stories and acceptance criteria
   - Include healthcare compliance requirements

2. **Constitutional Integration**
   - Apply KISS/YAGNI principles to requirements
   - Ensure testable requirements and validation
   - Include LGPD/ANVISA/CFM compliance considerations
   - Document architectural constraints and boundaries

3. **Archon Integration**
   - Store PRD in Archon for persistence
   - Create links to related documents
   - Set up version control for requirements
   - Enable knowledge base integration

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning
1. **Technical Architecture Design**
   - Define system architecture and components
   - Design database schema and relationships
   - Plan API endpoints and data flow
   - Consider healthcare data security requirements

2. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Create detailed implementation plan
   - Define development phases and milestones
   - Identify dependencies and integration points
   - Plan testing strategy and validation

3. **Compliance and Security Planning**
   - Design LGPD compliance measures
   - Plan data protection and encryption
   - Define audit trail requirements
   - Document healthcare security considerations

### Phase 4: Task Generation and Planning
1. **Atomic Task Creation**
   - Break down implementation into executable tasks
   - Define task dependencies and sequencing
   - Estimate effort and complexity
   - Identify parallelization opportunities

2. **Test-First Task Design**
   - Create test tasks before implementation tasks
   - Define unit, integration, and E2E test requirements
   - Plan compliance testing and validation
   - Include performance and security testing

3. **Resource Planning**
   - Assign tasks to appropriate team members
   - Plan development timeline and sprints
   - Identify required tools and environments
   - Set up monitoring and reporting

### Phase 5: Validation and Quality Assurance
1. **Requirements Validation**
   - Review PRD completeness and clarity
   - Validate technical feasibility
   - Check compliance requirements
   - Ensure testability of all requirements

2. **Plan Validation**
   - Review implementation plan for completeness
   - Validate task dependencies and sequencing
   - Check resource allocation and timeline
   - Verify compliance and security measures

3. **Quality Gates**
   - Ensure all constitutional principles are followed
   - Validate healthcare compliance requirements
   - Check architectural consistency
   - Verify test coverage and quality

### Phase 6: Documentation and Handoff
1. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Create detailed implementation documentation
   - Document API specifications and contracts
   - Create user guides and training materials
   - Document compliance and security measures

2. **Team Handoff**
   - Present PRD and implementation plan to team
   - Conduct knowledge transfer sessions
   - Set up collaboration tools and processes
   - Establish communication channels
