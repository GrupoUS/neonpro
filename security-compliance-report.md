## Risk Assessment - POST-HARDENING

| Risk Category | Previous Risk | Current Risk | Mitigation Status |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Data Privacy | HIGH | LOW | âœ… MITIGATED |
| Connection Security | CRITICAL | LOW | âœ… MITIGATED |
| XSS Attacks | HIGH | LOW | âœ… MITIGATED |
