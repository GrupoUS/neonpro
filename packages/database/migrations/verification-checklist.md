# Healthcare Database Implementation Verification Checklist

## Phase 3.3 Verification - Brazilian Healthcare Compliance

### âœ… Database Schema Verification

#### Multi-Schema Support

- [ ] **public** schema (main application data)
- [ ] **audit** schema (compliance and audit logging)
- [ ] **lgpd** schema (LGPD-specific compliance data)

**Verification Command:**

```sql
SELECT schema_name FROM information_schema.schemata
WHERE schema_name IN ('public', 'audit', 'lgpd')
ORDER BY schema_name;
```

#### Core Healthcare Tables

- [ ] **patients** - Enhanced with Brazilian identity fields (CPF, RG, CNS)
- [ ] **lgpd_consents** - Cryptographic consent management
- [ ] **appointments** - TUSS codes and no-show prediction
- [ ] **telemedicine_sessions** - CFM compliance and NGS2 security
- [ ] **consent_records** - Basic consent tracking
- [ ] **audit_logs** - Comprehensive audit trail

```sql
-- Set clinic context
SELECT set_clinic_context(
    'clinic-uuid'::uuid,
    'user-uuid'::uuid,
    'user_role'
);

-- Verify isolation
SELECT count(*) FROM patients; -- Should only show clinic patients
```
