## 🧠 INTELLIGENT ORCHESTRATION ENGINE

### **Core Execution Philosophy**
```yaml
EXECUTION_PRIORITIES:
  1. "IMMEDIATE ACTION - Use all available MCPs intelligently without hesitation"
  2. "CONTEXT AWARENESS - Load relevant rules only when triggers detected"
  3. "TOOL MASTERY - Leverage full MCP ecosystem for comprehensive solutions"
  4. "QUALITY ENFORCEMENT - Maintain ≥9.6/10 standards universally"
  5. "PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION - Fast, efficient, comprehensive results"
```

### **Trigger-Based Context Loading**
```yaml
INTELLIGENT_TRIGGERS:
  quality_detection:
    keywords: ["quality", "standards", "testing", "performance", "best practices"]
    action: "Load rules/quality-standards.md - Universal quality enforcement"
    context: "Quality gates + testing standards + performance optimization"
    
  security_detection:
    keywords: ["security", "auth", "compliance", "lgpd", "anvisa", "encrypt"]
    action: "Load rules/security-compliance.md - Security framework"
    context: "Authentication + data protection + compliance + audit logging"
    
  technology_detection:
    keywords: ["react", "nextjs", "typescript", "frontend", "backend", "api"]
    action: "Load rules/tech-patterns.md - Technology excellence"
    context: "React patterns + Next.js optimization + TypeScript best practices"    
  aesthetic_clinic_detection:
    keywords: ["aesthetic", "clinic", "beauty", "treatment", "patient", "cosmetic"]
    action: "Load contexts/aesthetic-clinics.md - Healthcare specialization"
    context: "Medical-grade quality + LGPD compliance + patient management"
    
  system_operations_detection:
    keywords: ["file", "directory", "system", "deploy", "server", "database"]
    action: "Load modes/operations.md - System administration"
    context: "File operations + system management + deployment automation"
```

## 🛠️ MCP ECOSYSTEM MASTERY

### **Core MCP Tools Integration**
```yaml
MCP_ORCHESTRATION_MATRIX:
  file_and_system_operations:
    primary_tool: "desktop-commander"
    capabilities: ["read_file", "write_file", "list_directory", "search_files", "start_process"]
    use_cases: "File management, system analysis, process automation"
    
  research_and_analysis:
    primary_tools: ["tavily", "exa", "context7"]
    tavily: "Web search, Q&A search, content extraction"
    exa: "Deep web research, company research, LinkedIn search"
    context7: "Library documentation, technical references"
    
  complex_problem_solving:
    primary_tool: "sequential-thinking"
    capabilities: "Multi-step analysis, hypothesis generation, solution verification"
    use_cases: "Architecture decisions, complex debugging, system design"
    
  database_operations:
    primary_tool: "supabase-mcp"
    capabilities: "Database queries, migrations, project management"
    use_cases: "Data analysis, schema design, production operations"
```
### **Intelligent Tool Selection Logic**
```yaml
TOOL_SELECTION_INTELLIGENCE:
  task_analysis:
    step_1: "Parse user request → Identify primary task type"
    step_2: "Detect domain triggers → Load appropriate context"
    step_3: "Select optimal MCP tools → Execute with loaded context"
    step_4: "Validate results → Apply quality standards"
    
  selection_patterns:
    "create/modify files": "desktop-commander (write_file, edit_block)"
    "analyze codebase": "desktop-commander (search_code) + sequential-thinking"
    "research topics": "tavily (search) + exa (web_search_exa) + context7"
    "database work": "supabase-mcp + desktop-commander for analysis"
    "system operations": "desktop-commander (start_process, list_processes)"
```

## 🎯 EXECUTION WORKFLOWS

### **Standard Task Execution Pattern**
```yaml
EXECUTION_WORKFLOW:
  simple_tasks:
    approach: "Direct execution with core tools"
    tools: ["desktop-commander for file ops", "basic context loading"]
    target_time: "<10 seconds"
    
  moderate_complexity:
    approach: "Multi-tool orchestration with domain context"
    tools: ["desktop-commander + research tools", "targeted rule loading"]
    target_time: "<30 seconds"
    
  high_complexity:
    approach: "Full ecosystem utilization with specialized modes"
    tools: ["All MCPs as needed", "comprehensive context loading"]
    target_time: "<2 minutes"
```
### **Domain-Specific Routing**
```yaml
DOMAIN_ROUTING_LOGIC:
  general_development:
    triggers: ["code", "component", "function", "debug", "implement"]
    context_loading: "rules/tech-patterns.md + modes/development.md"
    tools: ["desktop-commander", "context7 for docs"]

    triggers: ["research", "analyze", "compare", "investigate", "study"]
    context_loading: "modes/research.md"
    tools: ["tavily", "exa", "sequential-thinking for analysis"]
    
  healthcare_saas:
    triggers: ["patient", "clinic", "medical", "lgpd", "anvisa"]
    context_loading: "contexts/aesthetic-clinics.md + rules/security-compliance.md"
    tools: ["All tools with enhanced compliance focus"]
