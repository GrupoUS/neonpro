## 🇧🇷 **Brazilian Healthcare Regulatory Framework**

NeonPro operates within the Brazilian healthcare ecosystem and must comply with multiple regulatory bodies and laws. This document consolidates all compliance requirements extracted from the architecture documentation.

### **Regulatory Bodies Coverage**

- **ANVISA** (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária) - Health surveillance  
- **CFM** (Conselho Federal de Medicina) - Medical council regulations
- **WCAG 2.1 AA** - International accessibility standards

## 🛡️ **LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados) Compliance**

### **Core LGPD Principles Implementation**

#### **1. Consent Management System**
- [ ] **Granular consent collection** for different data processing purposes
- [ ] **Consent versioning** with timestamp tracking
- [ ] **Consent withdrawal** mechanism easily accessible

**Technical Implementation**:
```typescript
interface DataConsent {
  dataProcessing: boolean;      // Core patient data
  marketing: boolean;           // Marketing communications
  medicalPhotos: boolean;       // Medical photography
  researchParticipation: boolean; // Clinical research
  consentDate: string;          // ISO timestamp
  version: string;              // Consent form version

  withdrawalDate?: string;      // If consent withdrawn
}
```

#### **2. Data Minimization & Purpose Limitation**
