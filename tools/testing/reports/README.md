## Coverage Requirements

### Overall Coverage Targets

- **Minimum**: 90% across all packages
- **Healthcare Critical**: 95% for compliance packages
- **Security Components**: 95% for security packages

### Package-Specific Targets

```typescript
{
  "global": {
    "branches": 90,
    "functions": 90, 
    "lines": 90,
    "statements": 90
  },
  "packages/compliance/**": {
    "branches": 95,
    "functions": 95,
    "lines": 95,
    "statements": 95
  },
  "packages/security/**": {
    "branches": 95,
    "functions": 95,
    "lines": 95,
    "statements": 95
  }
}
```

## Healthcare Compliance Reporting

### LGPD Compliance Reports

- Data protection test results
- Consent management validation
- Privacy by design verification
- Data subject rights testing

### ANVISA Compliance Reports

- Medical device validation results
- Product registration testing
- Adverse event reporting tests
- Procedure classification validation

### CFM Compliance Reports

- Professional licensing validation
- Digital signature verification
- Electronic prescription testing
- Telemedicine compliance validation

## Report Generation

### Automated Reports

```bash
# Generate all test reports
pnpm test:reports

# Generate coverage reports only
pnpm test:coverage

# Generate compliance reports
pnpm test:compliance:reports

# Generate consolidated report
pnpm test:reports:consolidated
```

### CI/CD Integration

Reports are automatically generated in CI/CD pipelines and stored as artifacts for:

- Pull request reviews
- Quality gate validation
- Compliance auditing
- Performance monitoring

## Report Formats

### Coverage Reports

- **HTML**: Interactive coverage reports for developers
- **JSON**: Machine-readable coverage data for CI/CD
- **LCOV**: Standard format for coverage tools
- **XML**: JUnit format for CI/CD systems

### Test Results

- **XML**: JUnit format for CI/CD integration
- **JSON**: Detailed test results with metadata
- **HTML**: Human-readable test reports
- **Markdown**: Summary reports for documentation

## Quality Gates

### Coverage Gates

- Fail build if coverage drops below thresholds
- Require 100% coverage for new critical healthcare code
- Monitor coverage trends over time

### Compliance Gates

- Validate all LGPD requirements are tested
- Ensure ANVISA compliance scenarios are covered
- Verify CFM standards are validated

## Healthcare Data Protection

All test reports comply with:

- LGPD requirements (no real patient data in reports)
- ANVISA regulations (synthetic device data only)
- CFM standards (test professional data only)
- Comprehensive audit trails for all test executions
