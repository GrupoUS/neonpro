## Audit Results

### Initial Findings (Before Remediation)

**1 Moderate Vulnerability Identified:**

| Package | Version | Vulnerability | Severity | CVSS Score |
|---------|---------|---------------|----------|------------|
| esbuild | ≤0.24.2 | GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99 | Moderate | N/A |

**Description**: esbuild enables any website to send any requests to the development server and read the response

**Affected Paths**:
- `apps/api > vitest@2.1.9 > @vitest/mocker@2.1.9 > vite@5.4.20 > esbuild@0.21.5`
- `apps/api > vitest@2.1.9 > vite@5.4.20 > esbuild@0.21.5`
- `apps/api > vitest@2.1.9 > vite-node@2.1.9 > vite@5.4.20 > esbuild@0.21.5`
- Additional 8 paths through various dependency chains

### Remediation Actions Taken

✅ **Resolution Applied**: Added pnpm override to force esbuild ≥0.25.0

```json
{
  "pnpm": {
    "overrides": {
      "esbuild": ">=0.25.0"
    }
  }
}
```

✅ **Dependencies Reinstalled**: `pnpm install` executed to apply overrides  
✅ **Verification**: `pnpm audit` confirms no vulnerabilities remain  

### Post-Remediation Status

```
No known vulnerabilities found
```

## Security Assessment

### Package Security Analysis

| Category | Status | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Direct Dependencies** | ✅ Clean | All direct dependencies are up-to-date and secure |
| **Transitive Dependencies** | ✅ Clean | All indirect dependencies resolved to secure versions |
| **Development Dependencies** | ✅ Clean | Test and build tools are secure |
| **Production Dependencies** | ✅ Clean | Runtime dependencies have no known vulnerabilities |

### Risk Assessment

| Risk Level | Count | Status |
|------------|-------|--------|
| **Critical** | 0 | ✅ None |
| **High** | 0 | ✅ None |
| **Moderate** | 0 | ✅ Resolved |
| **Low** | 0 | ✅ None |

### Healthcare Compliance Considerations

✅ **LGPD Compliance**: No vulnerabilities that could compromise patient data  
✅ **Data Security**: All data handling dependencies are secure  
✅ **Authentication**: Auth-related packages (Supabase, JWT) are secure  
✅ **API Security**: Hono.js and related packages are secure  

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Completed)
- ✅ Applied esbuild version override to resolve moderate vulnerability
- ✅ Verified all dependencies are secure
- ✅ Documented remediation in version control

### Ongoing Security Practices

1. **Regular Audits**: Run `pnpm audit` weekly or before each deployment
2. **Automated Monitoring**: Consider integrating security scanning in CI/CD
3. **Dependency Updates**: Keep dependencies updated, especially security patches
4. **Version Pinning**: Use exact versions for critical dependencies

### Monitoring Setup

```bash
# Weekly security audit
pnpm audit

# Check for outdated packages
pnpm outdated

# Update dependencies (with caution)
pnpm update --latest
```
