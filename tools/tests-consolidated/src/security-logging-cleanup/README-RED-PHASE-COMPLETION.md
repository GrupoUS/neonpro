## üìù CONCLUSION

The RED phase for the Security Logging Cleanup task has been successfully completed with comprehensive failing test scenarios covering all aspects of console statement cleanup and healthcare compliance requirements. The test suite provides a solid foundation for GREEN phase implementation with:

- **2,455 lines** of comprehensive test scenarios
- **100% coverage** of identified console statements
- **Complete compliance coverage** for LGPD, ANVISA, and CFM
- **Clear success criteria** for implementation
- **Detailed implementation guidance** for development team

The test scenarios are designed to fail initially and will only pass when proper structured logging, console statement cleanup, and compliance features are implemented. This ensures that the GREEN phase implementation will meet all requirements and compliance obligations.

**Status**: ‚úÖ RED PHASE COMPLETE - READY FOR GREEN PHASE
