## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer working on the monorepo, I need a comprehensive audit and cleanup system that identifies and removes all unused, orphaned, and redundant code while ensuring all active resources are properly linked and follow architectural standards, so that the codebase remains clean, optimized, and maintainable.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a monorepo with mixed used/unused files, **When** the audit system runs, **Then** it identifies all orphaned, unused, redundant, and temporary files across apps and packages directories
2. **Given** code that doesn't follow architectural standards, **When** the validation runs, **Then** it flags all resources that don't comply with documented architecture patterns
3. **Given** improperly linked or routed resources, **When** the routing audit runs, **Then** it identifies all components, modules, and routes that are not correctly connected
4. **Given** the audit completes, **When** cleanup is performed, **Then** only actively used resources remain and all removed items are documented in a report
5. **Given** the optimization finishes, **When** the developer reviews results, **Then** they receive a comprehensive report of all changes made and architectural irregularities found

### Edge Cases

- What happens when files are indirectly referenced through dynamic imports or decorators?
- How does the system handle test files that should be preserved vs. obsolete test files?
- What occurs when architectural documentation conflicts with current code structure?
- How are circular dependencies or complex routing patterns handled during validation?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST recursively analyze all files and subdirectories within the apps and packages directories
- **FR-002**: System MUST cross-reference all discovered resources against architectural documentation in source-tree.md and tech-stack.md
- **FR-003**: System MUST identify and categorize all unused, orphaned, redundant, temporary, and obsolete test files
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate that all active resources follow documented Turborepo standards and routing patterns
- **FR-005**: System MUST trace all import dependencies, route linkages, and module connections to determine active usage
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve only resources that are actively referenced by the application code
- **FR-007**: System MUST generate a comprehensive report documenting all removed files and identified architectural irregularities
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle edge cases including dynamic imports, indirect references, and complex routing patterns
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate the final codebase structure maintains full functionality after cleanup
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide before/after comparison metrics showing optimization results

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Code Asset**: Represents any file or resource in the monorepo (components, modules, routes, tests, configs) with attributes for usage status, dependencies, and architectural compliance
- **Dependency Graph**: Represents the relationship network between code assets showing imports, exports, and routing connections
- **Architecture Document**: Represents the source-tree.md and tech-stack.md files that define standards and patterns for resource organization
- **Audit Report**: Represents the comprehensive documentation of all changes made, files removed, and irregularities found during the optimization process
- **Cleanup Action**: Represents each individual file or resource removal/modification with justification and impact assessment
