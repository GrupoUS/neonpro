# Quickstart: Monorepo Architecture Audit and Optimization

**Date**: 2025-09-09\
**Purpose**: Rapid validation of monorepo audit functionality\
**Duration**: ~15 minutes

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ with Bun installed
- Repository with `apps/` and `packages/` directories
- Architecture documentation at `docs/architecture/source-tree.md` and `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`
- Basic Turborepo workspace configuration

## Quick Validation Steps

### Step 1: Install and Setup (2 minutes)

```bash
# Install audit tool dependencies
bun install

# Verify tool installation  
bun run audit-tool --version
# Expected: v0.1.0

# Check workspace configuration
bun run audit-tool --validate-config
# Expected: ✅ Turborepo workspace detected, X packages found
```

### Step 2: Basic File Discovery (3 minutes)

```bash
# Scan monorepo structure
bun run audit-tool scan --dry-run apps/ packages/
```

**Expected Results:**

- Total files discovered: 500+ (depending on repo size)
- Files by type breakdown: components, routes, services, tests, configs
- No critical scan errors
- Scan completion under 30 seconds for 10k files

**Validation Checklist:**

- [ ] All TypeScript/JavaScript files discovered
- [ ] Package boundaries correctly identified
- [ ] Hidden and node_modules directories excluded
- [ ] File type classification accurate (spot check 10 files)

### Step 3: Dependency Analysis (3 minutes)

```bash
# Analyze dependency relationships
bun run audit-tool analyze --include-dynamic-imports
```

**Expected Results:**

- Dependency graph built successfully
- Import/export relationships mapped
- Circular dependencies detected (if any)
- Unused dependencies identified

**Validation Checklist:**

- [ ] All imports correctly traced
- [ ] Dynamic imports detected (if present)
- [ ] Circular dependencies reported with resolution suggestions
- [ ] External vs internal dependencies distinguished

### Step 4: Architecture Validation (3 minutes)

```bash
# Validate against architecture documentation
bun run audit-tool validate --docs docs/architecture/
```

**Expected Results:**

- Architecture documents parsed successfully
- Compliance rules extracted and applied
- Violations categorized by severity
- Turborepo/Hono/TanStack Router patterns validated

**Validation Checklist:**

- [ ] source-tree.md and tech-stack.md loaded
- [ ] File structure rules validated
- [ ] Framework-specific patterns checked
- [ ] Violation reports include specific fixes

### Step 5: Usage Analysis (2 minutes)

```bash
# Identify unused and orphaned files
bun run audit-tool find-unused --include-tests
```

**Expected Results:**

- Unused files clearly identified
- Orphaned dependencies detected
- Redundant code patterns found
- Test files appropriately handled

**Validation Checklist:**

- [ ] Actually unused files detected (manual verify 3-5)
- [ ] Important files not falsely flagged
- [ ] Orphaned dependencies correctly identified
- [ ] Test files properly categorized

### Step 6: Cleanup Planning (2 minutes)

```bash
# Generate cleanup plan without execution
bun run audit-tool cleanup --plan-only --backup
```

**Expected Results:**

- Cleanup plan generated with risk assessment
- High-risk actions flagged for review
- Impact assessment for each action
- Rollback strategy documented

**Validation Checklist:**

- [ ] Only truly unused files targeted for removal
- [ ] Risk levels appropriately assigned
- [ ] Impact on imports/routes calculated
- [ ] Backup strategy includes all affected files

## Full Workflow Validation (Optional - 10 minutes)

### Complete Audit Workflow

```bash
# Run complete audit with reporting
bun run audit-tool audit \
  --scan apps/ packages/ \
  --analyze \
  --validate \
  --cleanup-plan \
  --report-format html \
  --output audit-report.html
```

**Success Criteria:**

- Complete workflow executes without errors
- HTML report generated with all sections
- Before/after metrics calculated
- Recommendations provided for improvements

### Verification Steps

1. **Open Generated Report:**
   ```bash
   open audit-report.html
   ```

2. **Verify Report Sections:**
   - [ ] Executive summary with key metrics
   - [ ] File analysis with discovery results
   - [ ] Dependency graph visualization
   - [ ] Architecture compliance scores
   - [ ] Cleanup operations summary
   - [ ] Performance metrics
   - [ ] Actionable recommendations

3. **Validate Metrics Accuracy:**
   - [ ] File counts match actual repository
   - [ ] Dependency relationships are accurate
   - [ ] Architecture violations make sense
   - [ ] Performance metrics within expected ranges

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario A: Mixed Codebase Audit

**Setup**: Repository with mix of used/unused files
**Command**: `bun run audit-tool audit --full`
**Expected**: Clear separation of used vs unused code, accurate cleanup plan

### Scenario B: Clean Codebase Audit

**Setup**: Well-maintained repository with minimal issues
**Command**: `bun run audit-tool audit --strict`
**Expected**: High compliance scores, minimal cleanup recommendations

### Scenario C: Complex Dependencies

**Setup**: Repository with circular dependencies and dynamic imports
**Command**: `bun run audit-tool analyze --deep`
**Expected**: Circular dependencies detected with resolution strategies

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance (Reference Hardware: 16GB RAM, SSD)

| Repository Size | Files | Expected Time | Memory Usage |
| --------------- | ----- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Small           | 1k    | <5 seconds    | <100MB       |
| Medium          | 5k    | <15 seconds   | <250MB       |
| Large           | 10k   | <30 seconds   | <500MB       |
| Very Large      | 25k   | <60 seconds   | <750MB       |

### Performance Validation Commands

```bash
# Time the full audit
time bun run audit-tool audit --performance-metrics

# Check memory usage
bun run audit-tool audit --memory-profile
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "No architecture documents found"

**Solution**: Ensure docs/architecture/source-tree.md and tech-stack.md exist
**Command**: `bun run audit-tool --list-docs`

### Issue: "Permission denied on file access"

**Solution**: Check file permissions and directory access
**Command**: `bun run audit-tool --check-permissions`

### Issue: "Circular dependency resolution failed"

**Solution**: Review circular dependencies and break cycles manually
**Command**: `bun run audit-tool analyze --circular-only`

### Issue: "High memory usage during analysis"

**Solution**: Use incremental processing or increase available memory
**Command**: `bun run audit-tool audit --incremental`

## Success Indicators

✅ **All Steps Complete**: All quickstart steps execute successfully\
✅ **Performance Targets Met**: Analysis completes within time/memory limits\
✅ **Accurate Results**: Manual spot-checks confirm tool accuracy\
✅ **Clean Reports**: Generated reports are readable and actionable\
✅ **No False Positives**: Important files not flagged for removal

## Next Steps

After successful quickstart validation:

1. **Review Full Documentation**: Read complete implementation plan
2. **Run Production Audit**: Execute on real codebase with backup
3. **Integrate CI/CD**: Add audit checks to continuous integration
4. **Monitor Metrics**: Track architecture compliance over time

## Support and Resources

- **Technical Issues**: Check contract test results in `/tests/contract/`
- **Architecture Questions**: Review `/docs/architecture/` documentation
- **Performance Issues**: Enable `--debug` flag for detailed logging
- **Feature Requests**: Document in project specifications

---

**Validation Complete**: Feature ready for production deployment when all quickstart scenarios pass successfully.
