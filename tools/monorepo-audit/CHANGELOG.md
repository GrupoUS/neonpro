## Migration Guide

### From Manual Audits

If you're currently performing manual monorepo audits:

1. **Install the tool**: Follow the installation guide in README.md
2. **Run initial audit**: `bun run cli audit --dry-run` to see what would be changed
3. **Review configuration**: Customize `audit.config.json` for your workspace
4. **Execute cleanup**: Start with safe cleanup operations using interactive mode
5. **Integrate into workflow**: Add to CI/CD pipelines and development processes

### Configuration Updates

The tool uses a layered configuration system that automatically migrates settings from older versions. No manual migration required for configuration files.
