## Package Structure Analysis

### Export Patterns

**Comprehensive Exports** (Well-structured):
- `@neonpro/core-services`: 6 domain exports (scheduling, treatment, patient, etc.)
- `@neonpro/shared`: 5 specialized exports (api-client, hooks, schemas)
- `@neonpro/ui`: Theme-based and component-based exports
- `@neonpro/database`: Client and Prisma exports

**Simple Exports** (Basic structure):
- `@neonpro/types`: Single main export
- `@neonpro/utils`: Main + validation export
- `@neonpro/config`: JSON configuration files

### Build System Analysis

**Modern Build Setup**:
- `@neonpro/core-services`: tsup (CJS + ESM)
- `@neonpro/security`: tsc + tsup hybrid
- `@neonpro/shared`: tsc with build config

**Basic Build Setup**:
- `@neonpro/types`, `@neonpro/utils`, `@neonpro/ui`: tsc only

## Dependency Analysis

### Internal Dependencies

    A[core-services] --> B[database]

    D[shared] --> B
    E[ui] --> C
    C --> B
    F[security] --> G[config]
    F --> H[types]
```

### Most Depended On Packages

1. **@neonpro/database** - Foundation layer (Prisma + Supabase)
2. **@neonpro/utils** - Utility layer (helper functions)
3. **@neonpro/types** - Type definitions (scattered with shared)
4. **zod** - External validation across packages
5. **@supabase/supabase-js** - External database client

### External Dependencies Patterns

**Common Across Packages**:
- `zod`: Validation (7 packages)
- `@supabase/supabase-js`: Database client (6 packages)
- `date-fns`: Date utilities (4 packages)
- `typescript`: Development (all packages)

**Specialized Dependencies**:
- **UI**: `@radix-ui/*`, `class-variance-authority`, `lucide-react`
- **Security**: `bcryptjs`, `jsonwebtoken`, `jose`, `speakeasy`
- **Database**: `@prisma/client`, Supabase tooling

## Consolidation Opportunities

### üî• High Priority Consolidations

#### 1. Duplicate Config Issue
```
Problem: Two @neonpro/config packages (active + archived)
Impact: Confusion, maintenance overhead
Solution: Remove archived config, consolidate build configurations
Files: packages/config vs packages/_archive/config
```

#### 2. Types Scattered Across Packages
```
Problem: @neonpro/types + @neonpro/shared both handle types
Impact: Import confusion, duplication
Solution: Merge @neonpro/types into @neonpro/shared/types
Size Impact: 2.9M ‚Üí consolidated into 4.1M shared package
```

#### 3. Critical Compliance Package Archived
```
Problem: @neonpro/compliance in archive (LGPD/ANVISA/CFM)
Impact: Healthcare compliance features unavailable
Solution: Reintegrate compliance into @neonpro/security
Healthcare Risk: High - regulatory compliance essential
```

### üîç Medium Priority Consolidations

#### 4. Cache Utilities in Archive
```
Problem: @neonpro/cache archived but caching needed
Impact: Performance optimization unavailable
Solution: Integrate caching utilities into @neonpro/utils
```

#### 5. Integration Features Archived
```
Problem: @neonpro/integrations in archive (HL7, FHIR, EHR)
Impact: Healthcare system integrations unavailable
Solution: Evaluate for integration into @neonpro/core-services
```

### ‚ö° Low Priority Consolidations

#### 6. AI Features Archived
```
Problem: @neonpro/ai archived (chat, ML, workflow)
Impact: AI features unavailable for development
Solution: Review for potential reactivation or permanent removal
```

#### 7. Testing Package Structure
```
Problem: @neonpro/testing has no package.json
Impact: Unknown testing utility availability
Solution: Review contents and decide on consolidation approach
```

## Package Health Assessment

### ‚úÖ Healthy Packages (No Action Needed)

1. **@neonpro/database** - Well-consolidated, comprehensive Prisma + Supabase
2. **@neonpro/core-services** - Good domain separation, clear exports
3. **@neonpro/ui** - Standalone design system, comprehensive theming
4. **@neonpro/security** - Successfully absorbed @neonpro/auth

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Attention

1. **@neonpro/shared** - Overlaps with types, could be consolidated
2. **@neonpro/types** - Small, redundant with shared types
3. **@neonpro/config** - Potential duplicate with archived version

### üî• Critical Issues

1. **@neonpro/compliance** - Healthcare compliance features archived
2. **Archive management** - 11M of archived code needs review

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (P0)

1. **Resolve config duplication**: Remove archived config or merge differences
2. **Reintegrate compliance**: Move LGPD/ANVISA features to security package
3. **Consolidate types**: Merge @neonpro/types into @neonpro/shared

### Short-term Actions (P1)

1. **Cache integration**: Move cache utilities to @neonpro/utils
2. **Testing review**: Assess @neonpro/testing contents
3. **Integration assessment**: Evaluate @neonpro/integrations for reactivation

### Long-term Actions (P2)

1. **AI features review**: Decide on @neonpro/ai reactivation
2. **Archive cleanup**: Remove or document permanently archived packages
3. **Build system standardization**: Align all packages on tsup for CJS+ESM

## Success Metrics

### Before Consolidation
- 15 total packages (8 active + 7 archived)
- 40.5M total size
- Complex dependency graph with overlaps

### After Consolidation Target
- ~10-12 total packages (8-10 active + 2-4 archived)
- ~35M total size (12% reduction)
- Simplified dependency graph
- Zero critical compliance gaps

## Next Phase Preparation

This inventory provides the foundation for:

1. **Phase 2**: Dependency graph analysis with import/export mapping
2. **Phase 3**: Detailed redundancy detection using agent analysis
3. **Phases 4-6**: Systematic consolidation execution with quality gates

The package structure is moderately complex but manageable, with clear consolidation opportunities that align with constitutional principles (KISS/YAGNI) and healthcare compliance requirements.

---

**Key Finding**: Healthcare compliance features (@neonpro/compliance) are archived, creating a critical gap that must be addressed immediately for regulatory compliance (LGPD/ANVISA/CFM).

**Consolidation Potential**: 3-5 packages can be consolidated, reducing complexity by ~20-25% while maintaining all functionality.
