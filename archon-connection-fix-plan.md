- [ ] Restart MCP client connection
- [ ] Restart the entire development environment if needed

### 5. Update/Reinstall Archon
- [ ] Check for Archon MCP server updates
- [ ] Reinstall Archon MCP server if corrupted
- [ ] Verify compatibility with current MCP client version

### 6. Alternative Solutions
- [ ] Research alternative task management systems
