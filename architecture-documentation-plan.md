# Architecture Documentation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the tasks for creating comprehensive architecture documentation for the healthcare application. The documentation will cover all aspects of the system architecture, technology stack, data models, security, and deployment practices.

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Research and Planning

1. **Analyze existing architecture documentation**
   - Review existing architecture documentation in docs/architecture/
   - Identify what's already documented and gaps
   - Status: todo

2. **Research architecture documentation best practices**
   - Use context7 and tavily to research best practices
   - Focus on healthcare application architecture documentation
   - Status: todo

3. **Create comprehensive architecture documentation outline**
   - Develop a detailed outline covering all system aspects
   - Ensure alignment with healthcare industry standards
   - Status: todo

### Phase 2: Core Documentation

4. **Document system overview and context**
   - Create high-level system overview
   - Include business context, user personas, and system boundaries
   - Status: todo

5. **Document architectural patterns and decisions**
   - Detail architectural patterns used
   - Document key decisions and rationale
   - Status: todo

6. **Document technology stack and infrastructure**
   - Detail technologies, frameworks, and infrastructure components
   - Include version information and compatibility notes
   - Status: todo

### Phase 3: Technical Documentation

7. **Document data architecture and database schema**
   - Detail data model and database schema
   - Document data flow architecture
   - Status: todo

8. **Document API architecture and endpoints**
   - Detail API structure, endpoints, and authentication
   - Document data contracts and request/response formats
   - Status: todo

9. **Document security architecture and compliance**
   - Detail security measures, authentication, and authorization
   - Document compliance requirements (HIPAA, etc.)
   - Status: todo

10. **Document deployment architecture and DevOps practices**
    - Detail deployment pipelines and environments
    - Document monitoring and DevOps workflows
    - Status: todo

### Phase 4: Visualization and Finalization

11. **Create architecture diagrams and visuals**
    - Create system context, component, deployment, and sequence diagrams
    - Ensure diagrams are clear and comprehensive
    - Status: todo

12. **Compile and review final architecture documentation**
    - Assemble all documentation components
    - Review for consistency and completeness
    - Status: todo

## Execution Order

Tasks should be completed in the numbered order above, as each phase builds upon the previous one. This ensures a systematic approach to creating comprehensive architecture documentation.

## Success Criteria

- All documentation is complete and accurate
- Documentation follows healthcare industry best practices
- Architecture diagrams are clear and comprehensive
- Documentation is reviewed and approved by stakeholders
