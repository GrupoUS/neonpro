# Git Workflow Execution Instructions

## üöÄ Ready to Execute

All Git automation scripts have been prepared and are ready for execution. Choose one of the following methods:

## Method 1: Shell Script (Recommended)
```bash
cd /home/vibecoder/neonpro
chmod +x complete_git_workflow.sh
./complete_git_workflow.sh
```

## Method 2: Node.js Script
```bash
cd /home/vibecoder/neonpro
node execute_git_workflow.js
```

## Method 3: Python Script
```bash
cd /home/vibecoder/neonpro
python3 run_git_workflow.py
```

## Method 4: Manual Commands
If automated scripts fail, execute these commands manually:

```bash
cd /home/vibecoder/neonpro

# Step 1: Push current branch
git push origin coderabbitai/utg/b3d6a5a

# Step 2: Checkout to main
git checkout main

# Step 3: Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Step 4: Merge feature branch
git merge coderabbitai/utg/b3d6a5a --no-ff -m "Merge branch 'coderabbitai/utg/b3d6a5a' into main"

# Step 5: Push updated main
git push origin main
```

## üìã What Each Script Does

1. **Pushes current branch** (`coderabbitai/utg/b3d6a5a`) to origin
2. **Checks out to main** branch
3. **Pulls latest changes** from main to ensure it's up to date
4. **Merges the feature branch** into main with a proper merge commit
5. **Pushes the updated main** branch to origin

## üìù Logging

All scripts will create log files:
- `git_workflow_completion.log` - Success log
- `git_workflow_error.log` - Error log (if any failures occur)

## üîç Verification

After execution, verify the workflow completed successfully:

```bash
# Check current branch (should be 'main')
git branch --show-current

# Check recent commits
git log --oneline -3

# Verify remote status
git status
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If merge conflicts occur:
1. The script will stop and show conflict details
2. Resolve conflicts manually using `git status` and `git add`
3. Complete the merge with `git commit`
4. Continue with `git push origin main`

## ‚úÖ Expected Outcome

After successful execution:
- Feature branch `coderabbitai/utg/b3d6a5a` is pushed to origin
- Main branch contains the merged changes
- All changes are available on the remote repository
- Current working branch is `main`
