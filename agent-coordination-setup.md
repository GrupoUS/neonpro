# TypeScript Error Resolution Initiative - Agent Coordination Setup

## Overview

This document outlines the agent coordination strategy for resolving 143+ TypeScript errors categorized by priority levels. The setup follows the TDD orchestrator methodology and integrates with the quality control processes defined in `.kilocode/workflows/quality-control.md`.

## Agent Coordination Strategy

### Primary Agent Assignments by Priority

| Priority                             | Agent            | Focus Area                                            | TDD Phase Integration   |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **P0 - Critical Blockers**           | architect-review | System architecture, missing modules, database schema | RED/GREEN/REFACTOR      |
| **P1 - Security & Compliance**       | security-auditor | Healthcare data protection, authentication            | ALL phases (healthcare) |
| **P2 - Type Safety & Contract**      | code-reviewer    | Valibot schemas, HTTP responses, type safety          | GREEN/REFACTOR          |
| **P3 - Code Hygiene & Optimization** | apex-dev         | Unused imports, error handling, optimization          | GREEN/REFACTOR          |

## Conclusion

This agent coordination setup provides a comprehensive framework for resolving the TypeScript errors while maintaining healthcare compliance and system quality. The setup follows the TDD orchestrator methodology and integrates seamlessly with the existing quality control processes.

The coordination strategy ensures that:

1. Each error category is handled by the most appropriate specialist agent
2. Quality gates are enforced at each phase
3. Communication protocols ensure smooth agent handoffs
4. MCP tool sequences are optimized for each phase
5. Documentation requirements are clearly defined
6. Success criteria are measurable and achievable

Once the Archon MCP connection is restored, this setup can be directly implemented to begin the TypeScript error resolution initiative.
